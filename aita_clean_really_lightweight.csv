arfcfl,1550365421,AITA - Getting Hugged At The Bar," 

This all happened less than an hour ago.

I was at a bar I frequent and talking to some people I know, suddenly I feel someone from behind me hugging and starting to grind against me. I know a lot of people at the bar, and assume it's a friend of mine, but when I look down at the shoes I do not recognize them. I look back and I see a dude I do not know, nor have I ever seen. He looks back at me, with horror in his eyes, because I'm a dude too... I feel an urge of rage inside me and shove him in the chest with my elbow so I can get away.

He goes to his table and I go back to mine. I was with my roommate and his girlfriend. They asked what happened and I told them, then I see the guy who hugged me looking around for me. Him and two of his friends come up to us and he says:  
""I just wanted to apologize, I thought you were someone else.""

I respond, ""I understand, just check before you hug people. Now, please fuck off""

He repeats his last statement, so do I. This happens one more time and at this point his friends have surrounded me, my roommate is on his feet and I have left my beer at the table. His friend goes in my face and says.  
""He just wanted to apologize, you really shouldn't be yelling at us"" and starts waiving his finger at me.

We are at a rock bar, it's loud, I was speaking louder just to be sure I am heard.

The manager knows me so he comes asking me what happened. I explain the situation and he speaks with them then he tells me.  
""They want to say sorry, can you guys shake hand?""

""Yeah sure, I just want them to leave me alone.""  
Honestly I didn't even want to touch the guy, but whatever. We shake hands and they go away.

Me and my roommate look at their table and there's no one that looks anything like me. So, reddit, did I overreact? Am I The Asshole here?",False,not the asshole,3,14,0

bajsje,1554663842,AITA For going to 'expensive' restaurants in sweatpants and a shitty t-shirt?,"It's in Seattle if that matters. It seems people are a lot more casual here.

I was eating at a steakhouse I like and there was a family there who were there for like an anniversary or wedding or something. Bunch of people all dressed up obviously big get to do. 

I didn't think much about it at the time but I was talking to some people online and they said that you have like a basic responsibility to dress up at least a little at these places. The atmosphere is a big part of the experience and that I'm kind of ruining that. Also that it shows lack of 'respect' for people around me.

AITA?



I totally don't get why people care about the atmosphere (I'm there for the food) but if they care and I'm not respecting that...I'm the asshole.

cq6voc,1565771883,"AITA for wanting ""free gas"", due to an attendant's error","I was with my dad and driving the family car when I went to a gas station. I asked for $20 of 91. The attendant even repeated my request, and I said ""Yes, $20 91"". I paid cash, and the attendant went into the station to deal with the transaction. When he came out, I noticed he was putting the 89 gas nozzle into my car instead. I immediately tried to tell him that I paid for 91, but he wasn't paying attention. I yelled a bit louder and another employee (who looks like the manager) pulled the nozzle out. By that time, about $5 (give or take) of 89 had been pumped into the car. The manager went into the station to deal with the error, and started pumping 91. When it was finished, I was surprised I only got \~$15 of 91. I told the manager, ""I wanted $20 of 91"", and he said, ""You paid for $20 of gas, and you got $20 of gas"". I said, ""But I didn't ask for 89. Your employee was the one who gave me something I didn't want. Why should I pay for someone else's mistake?"" We kept arguing back and forth for a minute or so, until my dad said let's go, since it was clear we were getting nowhere. AITA for wanting that $5 of 91, even though I did in fact get $20 worth of gas?

Edited: for formatting

Edit 2: I guess I should've noted that no one apologized for putting in the wrong gas, and the manager was very dismissive. It might not seem like a big deal to you, but my dad is the one who likes 91, and dislikes mixing different octane grade gas in the tank. Yes, employees are humans who make mistakes, and what's done is done, so I would've taken either an apology or $5 of 91.

Edit 3: When I say argue, it's not like I yelled at the guy. We were just talking back and forth to each other sternly.",1565773989.0,not the asshole,49,40,0
bz4m2k,1560207411,AITA I asked my dad to replace the fuel that he used and he snapped at me,"Am I the asshole for asking my dad to replace the fuel that he used?  

&#x200B;

alright my dad has a bad temper. That's always been the case. He's known for beating up his siblings when they were kids. Now, my mom got pregnant and married him anyway because that's just how it is in our culture (this fucking drives me nuts everytime). 

&#x200B;

Last year, my mom got a new little starlet so that I could use it to pick her up from work everyday. She's too afraid to drive, so I obliged. I loved that car. It was so efficient, and I only spent $40 a week on fuel (I never had to ask my mom to pay for fuel). This year, my dad decided to show off to the boyz at work and sold the starlet. He got a nissan bluebird instead. Bear in mind that he already had 2 cars on finance (a bmw x3 and a mazda premacy) before getting the bluebird, which is also still on finance, btw. They all have big engines (at least 2.0). My mum and he had a deal that he's not allowed to use the bluebird to work. He's a really bad driver and he's already ruined the premacy. He never uses the BMW, he only uses it when there's a family gathering to fcking show off to our family friends and well family. 

So I've been using the bluebird for a while now, and now the fuel expenses on that car goes up to $80 so my mom also pays for the fuel. Heck, sometimes I even have to tell her 3 times that I need fuel money to pick her up. I pay my part of it, but I'm nothing but a poor uni student who depends on my part-time job pay. I only get $200 a week, but I have other expenses and I'm saving out to move out of this fucking shithole. 

&#x200B;

Today, he did not go to work and while I was making breakfast for myself (I am a bit of a health freak and I'm doing my best to get my shit together), I saw him take off using the bluebird. I just filled up the tank yesterday, and knowing him, he won't replace the fuel he used because he's fucking selfish but I tried anyway. I texted him, ""dad, could u pls replace the fuel that you'll be using today? I'm saving up for something. thnks."" 

He snapped real quick and called me and told me how he pays for it every week and all that. Now I'm looking up bikes online (which I should have done ages ago, btw), so that I won't have to deal with their shit anymore. 

I feel like I'm the only mature person in this house, tbh. They are both extremely inefficient and they make bad decisions all the time. They were also extremely abusive when I was a kid, so there's that too. The funny thing is that they talk shit about each other to us, their kids.

d88a9s,1569253485,WIBTA if I resign right before bosses are out of the office for almost 2 weeks?,"I work in a small office (less than 25 people).  Upon hire, I was informed the president of the company would be the person I report to.  His wife (who is the office administrator and company HR representative - which is an absolute joke, btw) was to be notified of vacation and sick days, etc.  About 4 months into the job, without notification, the wife assumed role of my manager.  First of all, she is not very knowledgeable about my exact position, and my role.  Second, she has a strong personality and is always correct.  It is her way or the highway.  Third, she is the type of person who often ""comes in hot"" on a topic and will escalate situations quickly, will raise her voice and even say inappropriate things.  During one of our interactions, she was getting frustrated as I was suggesting more detail to a project, while she was striving for ""efficiency"" - again, not fully understanding the scope of my work.  So she says to me ""Just because you don't understand what I'm saying doesn't make you a bad person"".  I kid you not.  First of all, I understood what she was saying, but her suggestions were not appropriate for the project (I later had 4 other people from the office -3 of the 4 were senior members of the team- who had overheard this exchange come into my office and offer support stating that this is just the way she is).  Since that interaction there have been several others where I have been belittled and bullied by my new manager aka the boss's wife.

My husband says it is affecting my life outside of work as I am often upset after work and my mood is often low because of the abuse I get on a daily basis.

&#x200B;

I don't want to ""screw"" over my co-workers.  But, this is an incredibly toxic environment for me and I need to get out quickly.

Should I put in resignation or wait until bosses return, then put in resignation?

bvxwjj,1559485669,AITA because I got kicked out over something quite petty and my parents still want an apology from me?,"When I was 18, I had a nice amount of cash from a car accident and offered to help my parents out with things they needed for the house. They told me to keep it for university
 So I wanted to use it for things I'd need. However , my parents summon me into the living room and told me that they wanted half of the car accident money. I asked why? They told me it was only fair. I told them no because they didn't force my older brother (who was claiming dole at the time and would just do what he wanted and smoked weed despite my dad being in the police) to pay anything. I was kinda upset that they would just demand the money, so I asked to go to my friend's house and talk to him about it. 

 He said that if I didn't want to stay at home, stay at his. But I needed some essentials and went back. But my mistake was telling my parents that I was staying at his for the night. 

I was then chased downstairs and my mother threw herself against the door. I raised my arms thinking she'd smack me (she's done it before) and then I'm grabbed by the collar of my coat and thrown to the floor by my dad. He proceeds to scream and yell in my face about how I'm a horrid ungrateful cow I was, and my mam did slap my face when I didn't respond. How could I? I was a tiny 18 year old paralysed with fear, clutching onto my bag terrified of what my parents were doing. Eventually my mam grabbed me, pulled me up and threw me out. I was left wailing in the street and went back to my friend's house to cry to him and his mam. They told me to just stay permanently. 

I tried going back a week later, but they both demanded an apology of me and after sitting there listening to them yell at me, I decided I didn't want to stay there anymore, and I left with my friend. 

In the 7 years since, I moved into a place with my friend, we've been dating for 4 and a half years but the family affair hovers around. Everyone except my dad have tried to talk about moving on, putting it past us and all that. My mam and I have had arguments were she still thinks that they didn't do anything wrong, and I've called her out. I've told her what I want which I think isn't unreasonable. I want her and my dad to apologise to me for their over reaction. That's it. But she told me that ""oh well I don't think he'd apologise"". Then what's the point? 

So what I'm asking is that am I an arsehole for not wanting to deal with them anymore? I've decided that for my mental health, no. I don't, but I'm concerned that they're gonna go around to the rest of the family, call me the arsehole and blame my boyfriend for the live I lead now

bn5hw7,1557531666,AITA for wanting help in the morning?,"My partner works shift work, about 35 hours a week and usually in the evening/weekends. He has two online classes he is taking at the same time. Most days he takes a nap, does some studying, the dishes or some laundry and then goes to work.  He wants to shorten this to 25 hrs. 

I work anywhere from 40-60 hours a week. It’s very much a “work goes with you” type job and is very stressful/fast paced. I also did an online course during this job, but am now finished.

We have two kids (6 and 10.) Both are active, which means extracurriculars 5 evenings a week, plus all the regular business of kids. Often I feel like between work, kids, cleaning, I have very little time to myself. 

Mornings are hectic. With all of us getting ready, kids eating, making lunches, etc - it is a race against time. I often ask my partner to wake up and help me out. On the days where he worked later the night before (past 11) I don’t ask for him to wake up. I then have to make sure to wake up earlier (takes longer to do everything on my own) and leave the house earlier (to get the kids to daycare and then to work on time).

Days when he wakes up it goes much smoother. I can sleep in slightly, and because he takes the kids straight to school I can leave a bit later. We still share the morning workload those days. 

Now, often he complains about this. He says that since he doesn’t work until later he shouldn’t have to get up. He also says that he just needs more sleep than me. This bothers me because not only am I constantly on the go and  exhausted, but I also have a disorder that causes me to have less energy (among other things). 

Catalyst was this afternoon. I was exhausted this morning, he woke up with me but was not happy. I thanked him for his help and went to work. At lunch I ran home to bring him food because I know he wasn’t feeling awesome and he was napping. When he woke up he started complaining again about how he should have slept in, and that he needs more sleep than me. 

I could not hide my frustration. I told him that I work long hours, have very little time to relax like he does, that I am constantly exhausted (he jokes that he can never watch a full movie with me because I can never stay awake) and the last time I slept while he got up was the day after Christmas last year. I told him that if he never wants to get up again, that’s fine, I will wake up earlier every day - but stop pretending it is because you are more worn out and start accepting it is because you just don’t want to help. 

So - am I the asshole for wanting help in the mornings even though my partner doesn’t have to get up for work?",False,no assholes here,7,12,0

they kept asking and drilling me on the same questions though which was like mother fuck lay off?

another one that got me is the sales guy didn't want me to take it on the highway if i wasn't willing to consider/ think about getting the car today and i told him  ""that depends on what kinda deal i can get with y'all and if i like this car""  and we take it on the highway and THERE is where i learned the car wasn't for me, it had no energy and i had to floor it to get past 60.. so i get back and they starting talking numbers like this shit is URGENT, we have other people who want this car ""cool sounds like you're gonna sell it eventually""(me) and like the sales guy gets SUPER pissed that i didn't buy the car on the spot when he let me take it on the highway and he starts telling his boss that but like there shouldn't be an issue with me taking the car onto legal roadways to test the cars functioning abilities. 

then the manager says to me ""brother i thought you came here to buy a car not waste our time"" which is like just angering cause when i got there i was into the car but it really doesn't perform to what i need it to for my daily commute. the guy also blamed my shifting in the manual for how it struggled on the highway but like i was in 4th doing 3k rmps and i shifted into 5th and there is where the car struggled(in its top gear?!) and other people had that one focal point to complain about the cars lack of sack on the highway(which i found out after reading on the test drive)

ewfnap,1580431060,AITA for refusing to burn my friend?,"This is the stupidest thing ever but according to my friend I'm being a bitch. Names and ages are changed. I know she doesn't have reddit but our other friends do so I'm not risking it. 

I (18) gave my friend Eliza (18) a stick and poke tattoo about a month or two ago while we were hanging out, and she had me get a similar one in the same area as a best friends thing. The tattoo is slightly smaller than a nickel in size and it's on the inside of her ankle. 

Tonight she just texted me saying that it was an emergency and she needs me to burn her tattoo off as her parents won't pay for college if she has one. She's extremely paranoid about student loans and refuses to take any out so this is a big deal to her. 

I told her under no conditions am I burning her to take the tattoo off. It will fade in a year, it's unlikely her parents will see it, and frankly it's ridiculous that she's asking me to intentionally burn her to take it off. I'm extremely uncomfortable with the idea of holding a lighter to her ankle just to get rid of it or burning anyone in general. I don't even know if the tattoo will disappear after the burn heals. 

She's really upset with me for telling her that ""under no conditions am I burning you"". I told her she can ask her boyfriend or any other friends but it won't be me . She thinks I'm obligated to because I gave her the tattoo in the first place and her boyfriend will probably fuck up burning it off but I doubt I'm any more qualified to do that. 

Am I the asshole for telling her I won't burn her?

edit: she also refuses to burn it off herself? she says concealer isn't an option since she might forget and it will be obvious when she wears flipflops at the beach.  she's a little bonkers but this might be the craziest thing she's ever asked me to do.

4vlby6,1470036194,AITA for throwing a couple of K-Pop Photocards in the air outside the arena of a concert instead of giving them away?,"Ok, so last Saturday, BTS, a K-Pop group had a concert in the Philippines. The crowd was extremely toxic (on my opinion) and people were hoping to get tickets, both legal and illegal, as well as freebies.

I'm not a fan but my sister is, yet she wasn't allowed to buy a ticket. So almost half of the whole day, we went around the mall (outside the arena) trying to obtain freebies.

Every time someone would give away freebies, people will run to the person and people wouldn't care about the person giving them away, even snatching every single one selfishly (example: banners, fan art). I even seen a situation where a fan art was tear in half. And it's kind of heartbreaking, especially for the owner, to see their art getting tear apart because people want to get them for themselves.

At one point, I saw another crowd, I decided go through the back instead of going with the crowd, this time the person was giving away some photocards. Since only a few was beside me, I got the chance to grab about 5-7 copies and blocked all hands trying to grab those cards and helped the person giving them away 'escape'. Now, what I did, even explained ""to be fair with everyone"", is threw the photocards one by one into the air. Some of them where saying (""Wag n'yo naman po itapon"" translates to ""Please don't just throw them"") OR (""Kahit isa lang po"" translates to ""Just one please"") but I ignored them. I threw all of those except one to keep it for my sister.

Anyway last night she smoked some weed and when we were talking she said shes ""taken 9 inches before"". I told her that is ridiculous and nobody is 9 inches and she said ""okay he said he was 7 and 3/4"". Then she said she wouldnt tell me who had the giant dick. 

I told her I couldnt tell if she was joking or not anymore and I was uncomfortable with the joke, and I explained it was because of me being a virgin prior to her while shes had 4 partners so it was a soft spot for me. She told me I was getting pissy and it was obviously a joke, and she said I always get annoyed with her when she gets high and it ruins her fun. Then she went to bed so that was the end of the talk.

I should add as a side note that Im pretty big down there (not 7 3/4 big) so I wasnt self conscious about myself - it was more just being uncomfortable about the subject as a whole.

About 9 months ago it raised its delivery price by another 25 cents, the drivers didn't get an upgrade in pay but no one really cared, so it was now drivers (Y) and company (Y plus $.25).

8nc745,1527713988,AITA Am I right to be upset at husband or crazy/insecure as he says?,"I {29/f} am upset with the several things my husband [27/m] has been doing lately.

The most recent issue: He went to the lake with his friend. I didn't go because I'm 36 weeks pregnant, didn't want to be out in the hot sun for hours and using their tiny little restroom every 30 minutes. I told him I may or may not join later, would let him know.

I decided to join hours later, I called when I got there.No answer. Some minutes later, I see his boat about to approach the dock. Before doing so, I saw him stopping next to a couple girls. They got in his boat, then another girl nearby (a friend of the 2 girls) was nearby and got in as well. He then took them for a boat ride for about 30-40 minutes. He never saw me waiting at the dock. He didn't know either because he didnt look at his phone to see my missed calls. So when he comes back, I'm pretty upset. I don't feel like he had business picking up 3 young girls in bikinis and giving them a ride. When he comes back, all of the girls give him a hug and thank him, one of them saying ""I hope your gf is not mad."" The girls didnt know I was there waiting for him. He saw me there and corrected her saying ""wife."" When they left, I asked him why they were on the boat. He said he just picked them up to help them get to the dock so they didnt have to walk a long distance. I asked how long, he said 10 minutes. So he lied straight up. I saw him pick them up, then go for a boat ride, that lasted 30-40 minutes while I roasted under the sun.

That is just one thing he did recently. I told him he is not single and that a married man had no business doing that. He says he did nothing wrong. He called me crazy and insecure. I have been in tears for days. Can barely eat or sleep well.

Am I right to be upset? Do I need counseling?

Edit: I'll just add a couple other things he has done to upset me. His ex gf called from her personal phone to let him know his deposit refund check is there in the office of his old apt, she works there (btw, it was supposed to have been mailed like the letter stated). He deleted that call from his log, went there to collect the check, and was MIA for 2-3 hours, lost his phone, and was late in picking me up. he lost his phone somewhere around that old apartment, then the car wouldn't start, he called tow truck services to jump start the vehicle when his brother lives down the street. He was not going to tell me he went there, I only found out by putting things together like his phone being lost and he's looking for it by the old apartment that his ex works at? And that he was late in picking me up bc car wouldn't start and didn't have a means to call me?

Another thing: He recently downloaded snapchat again. He was browsing through the contacts, deleting some people. This after he told me months ago that he deleted snapchat. Then I discovered that he had contacts on there and were subscribed to people he said he had blocked (these were women who sent him inappropriate videos while I was with him). These people were not just plain friends, they were exes, and women whose only purpose on snapchat is to show their bodies off.

One other thing: he's abusive. He has pushed me, twisted my hands so hard and sprained my finger that I fell to the ground out of the pain, and slapped me on several occasions. All while having a big pregnant belly. He says that if I disrespect him i deserve to have the shit beat out of me. We have different values. We're both Muslims but he is going on a different path. For instance I do not want to watch nudity or half-nudity scenes in our house. That is something he has hit me over because I tell him to stop watching it.

I am begging him to seek counsel since he thinks I am in the wrong. He says I am crazy & insecure and that he does nothing wrong. He refuses to seek counsel and says "" I dont give a f*** about what other people think is right or wrong, I know what I did was not wrong.""

I do however not have 8 close friends and thus she invited a few guys as well that are somewhere in between an acquaintance and a friend. My girlfriend paid €220 and each of my friends would pay only €10. All 10 of us are university students and have very limited budgets. 
Originally this should have been a surprise but I asked her to tell me beforehand because I have a lot of studying to do and need to plan my time accordingly. 

I feel like she created an economic incentive for my friends and not so close friends to come to my birthday, which I absolutely hate because i‘d only want to see the friends on my birthday that also want to see me not the „friends“ that want to have fun on my girlfriends budget. Additionally I feel like she just spent too much money. 
Because of that I asked her to either let everyone know that they need to pay their own share and to tell them there is no obligation to appear after the initial commitment by them or to just call it all off and say i‘m sick, which she decided to do as the other option would have been very difficult to communicate properly. 

She is now really sad and mad at herself as she feels like she should have known i‘d not want her to pay any of that.

I let my sister and her BF stay at my place for the time being cause they are new to the city and since I lived their I decided to be a good brother and give them a place to stay (they paid rent but I made sure it was pretty cheap cause I wanted to do them a favor).  They pretty much do their own thing and I don't see them much, but about once or twice a week we all sit down and watch a tv show or movie together (I live with my GF so I'm not the third wheel lol).  But on a commercial it was talking about the gym or something and my sister got all miffed that they were saying stuff like being fat is bad.

A bit of backstory, she isn't fat by any means, her fiancé is a little chubby but id say he's more stocky than actually chubby.  I am a bit stocky too from what people have told me.  When we were teens she was pretty mean to me about being fat, ill admit back then I was pretty fat but after HS I wanted to lose weight and get in shape and my sister was my biggest supporter.  But recently she's really into that ""body positivity"" and I think her BF is into that too.

I really thought he knew about her teasing me cause of my weight as a kid.  I hold no grudge over what she said to me as a teen cause I know she regrets it now and were good.  But when she said that I kinda smirked and jokingly said something like ""why couldn't you be so body positive when I was fat? you hated me as kids cause of that.""  I started laughing hoping that she would join in but I got nothing but a glare from her and her BF looking pretty shocked at what he heard.  He then got up and left the scene my sister called me a dumbass and went with him.  I didn't think anything of it, I heard some screaming and arguing coming from their room but I had the couch with my GF so I just blocked that out.

The next day they are SUPER tense around each other and I feel kinda bad, my sister is kinda pissed at me and said I should've just kept my mouth shut, while her BF is saying I did the right thing saying that.

dbonzb,1569907647,WIBTA if I found a new weight training partner?,"I'm on a sports team (at a D1 NCAA school) and have a close friend, let's call her Louise, who is always my weight training partner. She's my best friend on the team of 17 people.

We have weight training three days a week and Louise and I always share a bench, which is usually ok. The thing is that Louise is very very slow. When you share a bench, you also share equipment, so if Louise is still working through one exercise, I can't start my next set until she's done. This was fine when we didn't have timed workouts. I would wait for her to finish and then I'd do my sets. I might have to stay 5 minutes late, but it was worth it to be with my friend.

The thing is that we've just started doing timed workouts, where you have 20 minutes to complete as many circuits as you can and you are expected to either lift heavier or finish faster every time you lift. The problem is that Louise slows me down, so I'm in danger of not hitting my numbers while she's slowly finishing up with the equipment I need. She could be faster, but she insists on matching the weights I'm doing, so if I do an exercise with 20 lb weights, she isn't really ok with using the 15 lb weights. Our weight training partners are still kind of flexible but honestly, there isn't really anyone as slow as Louise. I don't know who she'd go with if I weren't her partner and we're friends so I don't want to leave her but at the same time, I don't want to get in trouble for being so slow.

d4lpub,1568560419,AITA for selling my engagement and wedding rings from my ex husband?,"We separated about 2 years ago. We got together when I was 16, he was 18 and were together roughly 5 years before being married for nearly 4.
Without going into the gory details, he was not the greatest husband, I suffered many forms of abuse throughout that relationship but eventually found the courage to leave him.
We aren't involved in each other's lives anymore, but are still on speaking terms, but only when entirely necessary. We still live in the same (reasonably) small town and are both seeing other people.  
I pretty much tell no one the things he did to me in that relationship, only my 2 closest friends who helped me through the break up, my sister, and my boyfriend. I originally kept quiet out of respect for him because I was still in that abused 'he's not that bad' kind of mindset. Now I keep quiet just to be the bigger person. He (being the manipulative sociopathic person that he is) has spun a whole web of lies about me to all the people who knew us as a couple, leaving out every terrible thing he ever did and placing all blame on me. That's fine, it doesn't bother me any more, but I'm just trying to paint a picture of why I don't want any attachment to him.  

Anyway...  
He bought and paid for the engagement ring which was worth about $2500 (he got it half price I believe) and I bought and paid for my wedding ring* which was about $1200. I want to sell them a) because the money would be good, even though I'm sure they're not worth much now, and b) because I want to be rid of them and what they symbolise.  
My boyfriend and sister think I should sell/pawn them, but my friends don't think I should. 
They think it would just make me look bad and if people found out it would just kind of make me look like the awful person he has told people I am... I'm also scared that one day he will ask for the engagement ring back and I won't know what to tell him.  
To be clear: he has never mentioned them and never asked for them back. However if I sell them I do not plan on asking/ telling him, mainly because I'm afraid of him and don't know how he would react + It's just another story to tell about me.

I was driving home from work around 5:30pm in May on a residential street. The sun was starting to go down a tiny bit, but it wasn't even reaching the point that I would call twilight. Good visibility, still quite sunny/bright. No clouds. I was driving behind a man in a white van who kept slamming on his brakes. I didn't know what that was all about, so just maintained a safe distance between us and kept on.

All of a sudden, he stopped in the middle of the street (not even at an intersection), put his van in park and jumped out of his car and started screaming towards me. He wasn't moving towards me and I was more confused than anything so I just sat there for a minute until he started gesturing at me and yelling louder. I rolled my window down a crack to see what he was yelling about, and he was screaming some variation of ""Turn your fucking headlights on!/Why aren't your lights on"" peppered with lots of profanity.

At this point, I was kind of pissed that he was blocking my way and yelling at me for something that wasn't even illegal. So I turned my headlights on and then flashed my brights at him. He kept yelling so I flashed them a few more times and he got in his van and sped off. I told the story to my friend and they told me I was an asshole for flashing my brights at him, but I was trying to express to him that a) I heard him and b) he was being a jerk without actually confronting him.

bpszpy,1558108441,AITA for treating my stepdad like just some dude for the past 6-7 years?,"[Ok so the first thing I want to say is this is my first post and it’s on mobile so if things jump around I apologize. I also don’t want to make this into a wall of text but this is an emotionally complicated thing for me so it’s hard to explain shortly but I’ll do my best.]

I’ll start with, well the start. I would have been around 10(m) at this point in time and I’m now 16 almost 17. Around 2012 my mom and dad got divorced. I have no clue when this happened and I barely remember the year because I have tried (wether consciously or subconsciously) to suppress as much as I can about everything that’s happened. My mom was the one who left unlike what seems to be most peoples stories of the other way around. I can’t even explain how hurt and destroyed I was then so I’m not going to try and explain it now. All you need to know is that it was really f-ing bad for me and my dad emotionally. We felt completely betrayed. I lived about as comfortable as a life as I could have after all that happened.

 So fast forward to the past 2-3 years and I live primarily with my dad and visit my mom on weekends. (Also I’m gonna clear this up now, I love my mom to death even after everything that happened and I can’t thank her enough for everything she’s done for me).  My mom and now stepdad weren’t actually married until about 2-3 years ago so my title might not be 100% accurate but he was around from the start they just weren’t married. This is where the AITA shit begins. I treat my stepdad like he is basically nobody. Just some random dude with no relation to me and I’m starting to feel like an ass cause of it. This dude has done so much for me. He makes my mom happy, he’s pretty much the only reason we can get super nice stuff because my mom is a librarian, he gives me presents on my bday and Christmas, and he’s the reason we’re about to move into a much nicer house than what we currently live in.  And yet after all of this I still can’t bring my self to be thankful, or at to least show him I’m thankful. 

Am I the asshole for ignoring and treating my stepdad like he’s unrelated to me for so long?

{If you need more info or context I’ll try my best to answer and give you the info you need. I will also be accepting whatever judgment you guys pass and depending on what is judged I’ll try to be better towards him and show more appreciation. I also will gladly take any advice given.}

Edit 1: Ok I’m gonna bring this up now because I feel like it’s necessary at this point. I haven’t been told why the divorce happened and have been told if I still want to know when I’m 18 my dad will tell me. But now my grandma has already told me. We were talking a few months ago and I asked her if my mom cheated on my dad and she didn’t say yes directly but she basically confirmed it. If she didn’t cheat it wasn’t anything better, that’s all I know. I should also mention this was my dads 2nd divorce (basically 3rd but he wasn’t married to the first)  and that also weighs on my mind and how I feel about everything.

Edit 2: wow I sure am editing a lot for a 30 min old post. So I also feel like I should bring up that while my stepdad does buy me things. If anything it feels like he’s just buying me over until I stop visiting, outside of that the ignoring is mutual. Neither of us actively try to talk to each other or engage with one another. He’s never once said he loves me and I’ve never said it to him. The only time we ever communicate is asking each other questions like where my mom is or what we want for dinner.

bwa7jt,1559565631,AITA for threatening to publish nude photos sent by sister's harrasser if they didn't leave her alone,"Late last year after my sister (15) started Year 10 at school, Dean - someone that I'd known from the year before when I finished and moved onto an apprenticeship (working and education for non-UK connasseurs) started flirting with her in a rather one-sided conversation and eventually sent her dick pics and other nudes. She didn't like this and eventually came to me with these photos because it was making her really uncomfortable after which I spoke to Dean on messenger telling him to leave her alone. Instead of apologising he ran his mouth at me, tried to act like a keyboard hardman - so I got my sister to forward screenshots of the nudes/dick pics Dean sent (with his name tagged on them from messenger) backed them up to various secure places then passed them onto Dean warning him that if he didn't leave her alone I'd make it public that he was pestering a younger girl who wasn't interested in him and leaves printed copies of the nudes outside my old school (where he was still in sixth form, my sister was 2 years below him in y10). The threat of public humiliation seemed to work as he apologised then cut off contact and my sister didn't hear anything from him for a while.

The only reason this has come to mind again is because while on my personal laptop (I use it for education) at the college I was going through some old folders that I'd forgotten about with a few others and stumbled across one of the caches I had of Dean's naughty photos.

One day I called him and we meet for drinks, he introduced me to some of his new friends, and we all have great time together and I invited them to my place for a cookout, and that repeats a couple of times, we go out, have drinks, they come over, I cook for them and we chill, everything's great.

I noticed him being fairly close to this one girl in the group but didn't think much of it. Later out of curiosity I asked him if he felt anything for her, and he basically said that he likes her as a friend and that she's a cool person to hang out with, later I asked her the same question and she gave me the same answer, they're just friends. So I started chatting with her and slowly, we started spending more and more time together and then we started dating in secret at first, we didn't want to tell anyone until we were sure it's not just a fling, after a month or so, we decided to tell all our friends but in a nice way, we wanted to suprise them becouse it's all good news. So I invited them all for a dinner.

She goes first and tells them that she's staying in the country, and it's cheers and hugs all around, then I told them we're together and at first there's shocked silence then again yelling and cheering but I noticed him being unusualy quiet. That evening he stayed short, excused himself and left early. Tomorrow I sent him a message to see if everything is alright, but he didn't answer for the first time in 4 years. Then a week or so later my gf came home and said that he confronted her in the mall and told her that she rushed into this, that she needs to beware of who I am, and that she's making a mistake. She didn't know what to say and frankly neither did I when she told me about it but now we knew we had a problem on our hands. He just tried to sabotage my relationship behind my back!

So another month passes, I gave him time to answer my messages, he didn't, and she tells me again that he confronted her about us, he told her that WHEN our relationship is done, we are no longer friends, and basically that I am this big bad guy and she's making a mistake. Now I couldn't tolerate this any longer and I gave him a call and asked him what's up trying really hard to stay polite, he then told me that this was completely unacceptable of me, dating his best friend, and that it's her fault too choosing me over their friendship that it's like I'm dating his sister again, and that we are no longer friends. I tried to talk some sense into him but in vain. 

Now basically I lost a friend, she lost a friend, the whole group of friends is sided one way or the other and no one is talking about it, I have no idea what went down, my only working theory is that he was secretly in love with her and didn't want me to know, we are still together and doing great but the whole situation is kinda sad for us every time we remember him.

8bhbmt,1523455675,AITAH for asking my aunt not to send messages to me that I considered disrespectful,"Im just going to type out the exact conversation and you guys can make of it what you will.

---Edit---

I left very little context to try to avoid bias, but that led to a number of assumptions from being made. The situation is that I don't check my phone very often, and this is the first direct communication I have gotten from my aunt. I did not see the messages until today. I considered her 'follow up' message extremely childish and wanted to avoid having those sorts of interactions going forward as they are very common in my family. This is mostly here for clarity/posterity, judgement seeeeemssss basically done. (IATAH)

My objective in my (rude) 3-sentence message was to make it clear that I considered her message unacceptable, That I understand that she is upset but it is not a good reason to send messages like that, and to avoid having those sorts of interactions in the future. The negative-caps lock-angry messages is something that is common in my family and which I hoped to 'put my foot down' and avoid in my adulthood.

I interpreted her response as a 'dodge' and deflect. She has a history/reputation of being extremely petty/passive aggressive (something I didn't want to share initially for bias reasons). Asking someone to ""see a professional"" is a very common and fairly serious insult in my family, as there is a major stigma against mental health issues.

A few commentators don't believe me that I don't check my phone often, which is odd. I have attempted to be a 'reliable narrator', as much so as possible. I do believe everything I am sharing to be true. If I was interested in making myself look good to internet strangers, it wouldn't be hard to make actual changes to the narrative to do so, or share more 'context' then what is necessary to understand the situation.

In all seriousness, my cat was an outdoor cat when I lived with my parents. So, basically her entire life. She is six years old. My parents live in a cul-de-sac and I felt like the neighborhood was relatively safe. My cat is extremely smart and I trust her with taking care of herself out there.

I recently moved out of my parents house into apartments out in the mountains. There are more wild animals out here and I don’t really trust people to let her roam free especially since she’s such a friendly cat. She only lets people she trusts pick her up but if a stranger becomes someone she trust, they can easily take her away. The neighbors at my parents house knew it was our cat.

dckg0h,1570068383,AITA for telling my sister to pay me back for a graduation trip I took her on?,"My(24F) sister(18F) and I have always had trouble getting along. When she was 12 she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I'll admit I used to be someone who didn't really believe in mental illness, but over the years due to my sister and friends I've tried to become more accommodating to those types of things and our relationship had improved greatly due to that. I'm still not the best at understanding it, but I try.

My sister ""graduated"" from school in June. She had struggled with school due to her illnesses. She school a lot and failed several classes prior to her senior year, but by the grace of her counselor and her own determination, she managed to walk.

When she graduated I told her as a present for her hard work I'd take her anywhere she wanted. She chose Taiwan since she studied Chinese in school and because I lived there for 1.5 years during college and said it was a great place to visit.

Before booking the trip I asked to see her diploma, but she and my mom told me it was delayed due to a grade being put in late and wouldn't arrive for a few weeks. Since my mom was backing her up I said okay and we booked for early August.

The trip goes on and we have a great time. I accommodated her anxiety by going to tourist spots during dead hours, eat at off hours, stay in when needed, etc. At the end of the trip my sister told me it was the most genuine fun she's had in a long time.

Life goes on, September is nearly over when my youngest sister(16F) calls me up. We talk for a while, she finally complains about our sister sleeping late. I get confused because she shouldn't be sleeping late due to attending college?

Younger sister tells me that our sister didn't actually graduate and she thought I had known. She was supposed to finish an online class to get her diploma but never did. I immediately call up my mom and dad who confirm it. I then told my mother that I would like sister to pay me back for her ticket as that was supposed to be a graduation present. My mother gets upset and tells me I need to respect sister's mental health and she can't do that right now. We argue and my mother hangs up.

I decide to go home the next day and confront sister about her diploma. I try to talk about it but she starts crying the second I mention her diploma. To be short I ended up telling her that she can either find a way to get her diploma within the year, or she has to pay me back for her plane ticket at least. My sister cries that she can't do that - she needs a mental break and can't handle getting her diploma right now, can't say when she will get it, and can't pay me back.

It's been several days but sister and parents all say I'm a complete asshole for wanting my money back. Younger sister is on my side, but she is very similar to me. My friends are also very divided. Quite a few say I'm an asshole and shouldn't risk my sister's mental health over $1000, while others think my sister needs to face reality, which I agree with.",False,not the asshole,13,48,0

I am a photographer. I specialize in children and babies but occasionally work with families as well.  An aunt to one of my sons friends has asked me to do a large extended family session (30 people) for them. They have chosen a time/location that just isn’t really ideal. Theres only so much flash/reflecting that can be done with a group this size and its honestly going to be more work than the session costs.   

 I suggested two things, 1. Change the time to later in the day when the sun wasn’t so harsh and unflattering or 2. Drive a little further down the same road and utilize an area with a nice tree bed to allow an even continuous lighting. Both options were a no for the client. 

Am I an asshole if I chose to not shoot the session? They haven’t booked yet. Theres still a few weeks for them to check out some recommendations I have to offer (although, none of them have jumped for joy at the opportunity themselves either).

Now we head out even though he doesn't have his bike and about 20 minutes later he realizes that he's never going to make it walking. He asks me for mine and of course I say no, then he goes onto say that he has a presentation that he can't be late to because this is their last day for it. I'm still reluctant to let him borrow my bike and keep refusing. He then gets mad and starts jogging towards our school and I bike after. He tells me to just go away and leave.

Another thing I should mention is that I start later than he does so I wouldn't have been late.

So when I was 11-13 my parents were heavy alcoholics and my Dad was homeless. My Mom and my stepdad would get physically and mentally abusive (I could elaborate but I don't feel comfortable doing so on the internet). It ended for the most part after the second time I called the police and my stepdad got arrested. Afterward my mom drank heavy and shamed me for about a week. The new problem arose when my stepdad got released. He was on house arrest and wasn't allowed to have contact with us for a month. My mom decided it would be a great idea to take us to visit him two days after he was placed on house arrest (he was only in jail for 10 days).I was uncomfortable with the interaction and tried to walk home but I felt like my mom forced me to stay. My stepdad was perky and uncomfortably happy. His initial response to me calling was positive but slowly after he started poking fun and shaming me. I brought up how fast we were interacting to our social worker and the interaction went something like this:
( social worker was asking about our relationship )
Me: I don't know. I feel like he came home to early.
Stepdad: What do you want me to do zilla? Do you want me to move away?
Idk but for some reason that and the events mentioned before eat at me a little. Now I'm 17 and all the social workers and what not are gone. I am severely depressed and frustrated as I cannot drive and I cannot work by my moms choosing. My stepdad and I are always back and forth over stupid things such as me messing up while making coffee ( filter broke and grounds got into the pot ). I try to explain to my mom why I am sad and she essentially says ""Oh I understand my mom did etc."". I don't know if it's her trying to relate to me but I'm trying to discuss current issues that are plaguing my life. Then I try to explain to my stepdad why I don't trust him and my problems with his tone and comments. He gets angry and then I bring up his previous actions that I remember. He gets uncomfortable and says he doesn't remember doing those things and asks me to quit talking about them as they hurt his feelings. I just want him to understand three things
1. Why I don't trust him
2. Why I cannot just let it go
3. Why I don't like his tone and the manner he presents himself with (It's very similar to when he was drinking)

This department is really big on food days, celebrating birthdays, holidays, and on occasion ordering in food. 

I have Crohns, and usually cannot eat any of the food brought in or ordered because I have extreme sensitivities and just never know what will set me off. I’d rather not partake than risk an issue. My boss and most of my coworkers are aware that I have issues, and I have insisted plenty of times that they shouldn’t feel bad or attempt to cater to my issues. My supervisor feels bad sometimes, but I’ve insisted that I’m ok with it (and I do mean it, I’m not upset about being excluded).  

So the AITA part: everyone in our department makes a big deal about saying a big thank you, sending an email and CCing the entire department, etc. I don’t usually reply because it doesn’t apply to me - they know I can’t have it, and I don’t see a reason to say thank you for food I won’t be eating.

 My apartment complex has a dog park that happens to be adjacent to my building, and I am a smoker who is often outside sitting at the picnic table outside of my building. For about a month now I've noticed a young boy, about 12-14, who brings his dog to the dogpark occasionally at night. Occasionally as in, I've seen him about 6 times this month. Every single time he is out here with his dog he abuses them. He shoves, he pushes, and he verbally assaults his dog. He will kick the fence and scream/yell for him to come. Ignoring the fact that he never even goes into the dog park to pick up after his dog as well, he is just an absolute nightmare to listen to. I hear and see him yelling, and dragging, and yanking his dog every freaking time. All the while he is on his phone screeching to whoever the fuck is his friend. I got so fed up, that today after he yanked his dog out of the park, with a loud yelp from the dog with his tail between his legs mind you, that I walked to the front of the building and watched which other apartment (out of 8) that he walked into. I have no idea how to go about reporting him to anyone, even if I speak to management he is a minor and I don't know who he even is, all I know is the building he is in which has 8 different families/apartments in it.

I asked for a vegetarian sandwich and she didn't change her gloves. She put pepperoni on the sandwich and I reminded her it was vegetarian. She simply took it out and didn't change the bread. She then toasted it without me asking so even though I didn't want her to. Finally, she put sauce I didn't like or want on it.

b40jgm,1553228257,"AITA? My mom uses my towel specifically, so I hid all of the clean towels in the house to teach her a lesson","I apologize if the format is bad, I’m on mobile and I’ve never posted before. 

So I [19F] am in college, so I live with my mom still to save money. I buy most of my own food, clean up after myself, and clean up after my whole family (including my mom’s untrained Great Dane). 

I also am the only person in the damn house (out of four adults, a teenage boy, and young sister) that washes any towels, washcloths, or dish cloths. I don’t mind it that much, since it keeps dirty towels from piling up, but there is something that irritates the living hell out of me. 

I use the same two towels for up to a week (one for my head, one for my body) in order to cut down on laundry and save water. I hang my two towels up in the bathroom, and everyone knows they are mine and not to touch them. 

The problem is that my mom likes to use my towels, even if there is a nice clean stack of towels in the closet that I just washed. I don’t don’t use the best towels in the house or anything, I just grab them and go. So I don’t know if she does this because she’s too lazy to grab a towel before she gets in or just to piss me off, but I find it gross. She leaves them soaking wet in the floor afterwards. And why would she prefer a used towel over a freshly washed one anyways?

Furthermore, I usually don’t realize my towels are gone until I go to get out of the bath or shower and I have to walk to right outside of the bathroom to the closet to get a towel (if there are any clean even). 

I finally got so pissed off when she used my towels today, that I took all the towels I washed yesterday (two loads) and hid them in my room. She still has these small towels used more for decoration than anything that she could use, or she could wash the pile of towels she used to clean up her dog’s piss. Also, I’ll put the towels back after I feel like she has learned not to piss off the only person who washes towels in the house. 

This revenge feels nice, but I don’t know if I’m actually the one acting like an ass here. Any thoughts?

EDIT: making this post has made me realize that this towel thing isn’t really just for getting petty revenge for her taking my towels. Since her new marriage me and my sister have both felt like she is putting her husband before us and we have tried to talk about it to her, but she just gets angry at us for talking about it. I think I just wanted petty revenge for a problem that is too big to solve over simple towels. My sister and I have been planning on moving for a while, despite my mom’s protests. Till then, I will be putting a majority of the towels up, but keeping a couple in my room for when she steals mine😈.

Ltl ftp mobile all that stuff. So I (25f) recently decided to get back on the dating scene after a hiatus spent focusing on my setting up a career and life. I joined tinder not expecting much but figures what the hell. Today I matched with a guy who seemed nice enough, not my normal type but still decent and not creepy. When I first saw his profile something about him seemed familiar but I couldn't place it. Well he matched with me and we did the normal small talk before I mentioned that I thought I knew him from some where. He explained that we had known each other 5-10 years ago when were both in school. 

As soon as he said that I remembered exactly who he was. He was friends with my older sister, and at the time, neighbor/best friend. He actually dated my friend for a while and it ended rather badly. I remember him being real douchey at the end of the relationship and when they broke up we never really saw him again. 

Now I know this was close to 10 years ago and that people can change but I also remember my friend going through hell at the end of that relationship. Now when I see that he messaged me I cant help but remember that and I am really hesitant to enter into anything with him. The problem is my sister and several other friends are friends with him on Facebook and I don't know what the potential backlash would be if I just ghosted this guy who has honestly been nothing but nice so far.

I really do enjoy myself, but due to the stigma around furry art, the furry community, etc, I like to keep my interests relegated to online forums and communities.

Nothing came of it. Joe and I became good friends, and I became privy to a lot of personal details about him. He’s a vet with PTSD, an alcohol abuse problem and the tendency to cheat on every girl he’s ever dated. He and I no longer have any contact for a number of reasons, all to do with his shitty behavior. 

Cate’s marriage fell apart (her husband was cheating on her it turns out) and she quickly started dating another guy that she ended up engaged to for a bit. I have told Cate about Joe’s instability and infidelity before as he has come up in conversation a few times, especially when he and I were still on good terms. I didn’t share the more personal details as those are his stories to tell, simply shared that he can’t keep it in his pants and he’s not as great to date as she fantasizes he would be. Life happens and Cate and I rarely see each other now as we no longer work together. 

Last time we went for lunch she told me she had finally broken it off with her boyfriend (he was basically leaching off of her, living in her house and treating her 3 teen kids poorly). She was glad to be single and planned to take some time for herself. 

Fast forward to this summer. I was at another friends place who still has contact with Joe, and he told us that Cate reached out to Joe with a lingerie clad photo and an invitation to casual sex. Joe had showed the photo around. Obviously he dove in dick first. Shortly after that he was telling the same mutual friend that Cate is crazy, he needs to call it off but doesn’t know how to get rid of her. 

A couple of weeks later, Cate is posting photos of her middle son out on a day of hunting and fishing with Joe (they pulled him out of school for the day for this outing). Thing obviously progressed beyond casual sex at this point. 

I Have not talked to Cate about this relationship in person yet, but got a text from her saying that she should have listened to me, and from what I gather things have gone south with Joe. 

My husband says to stay out of it, but WIBTA if I told her the truth: 1. That Joe was showing the photo to other people 2. That he was saying unflattering things to others and wanted to end things long ago and 3. Warning her that sending her kid out hunting with him is extremely dangerous (my hubby hunted with him last year - he got drunk, forgot to use the safety on his gun and left it loaded) 4. That he’s been through rehab twice before and should go again if he’s still drinking like a fish and 5.

I didn’t make it a big deal to her, just casually mentioned it and she said oh whoops and that was that. 

The second example was when I was at work in October and had texted her to remind her to shut and lock all windows and doors before she went out. She doesn’t see safety as a serious issue as we live in a quiet part of the UK and she does usually forget to shut windows. I got a panicked phonecall 4 hours later with her telling me our home had been burgled because she’d forgotten to shut a window. I came home to the police at my home and my entire house smashed to bits on the inside.

The burglars had taken amongst other things, my m5  (car keys were on the sideboard) which I had worked years to be able to afford. I still haven’t recouped the loss to this day as my insurance didn’t cover theft. I love my wife so so so much but my trust in her memory was irrevocably broken and so every time we are to leave the house now I always do a thorough sweep to make sure nothing is left plugged in/ windows are shut/ etc. 

She absolutely hates this and tells me that I’m undermining her. She will snap and say ‘what, you don’t think I’m capable of shutting a window?’ And I am starting to become a bit frustrated at her lack of care. She STILL doesn’t shut the bloody windows! I have never ever taken my upset out on her- she is the love of my life- but I am absolutely not about to trust her with the locking up of the house. She thinks I’m infantilising her, I think I’m being sensible. She thinks I’m undermining her when I go to recheck if things are shut, I think I’ve been burned before and don’t want to be burned again.

bvpphx,1559423977,WIBTA if I broke ties with an emotional friend?,"(TL;DR at the bottom)

My best friend decided to start a relationship with my other close friend. I told him it would be a bad idea because if they ever broke up, it would severely impact our group of friends. He went through with it anyways, and after a month he wanted out of the relationship because he found her too clingy. He decided to end it asap because he didn't want her to get too attached. After a month and a half, they broke up.

About the girl:
I've known her for a while and had dated her a few years ago (lasted about 3 months, broke up with her because she was pulling me away from my other friends). She seemed to be ok after about a week. She started dating guys constantly for short periods of time (average relationship time: 2 months). She gets very emotional after each breakup, but is usually fine after a week, then goes and finds someone new. She shows signs of being bipolar and depressed, but nothing has been confirmed.

About their relationship:
She was extremely clingy and got very attached in the first week. They would constantly stray away from the rest of the group and make out, leaving everyone else feeling awkward. When they were alone, she would start crying if he asked her to go home a bit early for whatever reason. He was not happy in this relationship, but she seemed very happy. When they broke up, she started bawling and rushed home. The next day we saw cuts on her arm.

Now:
Whenever we go out as a group she insists on coming with us, especially if my best friend is there. During most of the day she seems perfectly fine and happy. However, when it starts to get late, things change. She always wants me to comfort her and try to make her feel better since I've known her for a long time. My best friend just stands there and doesn't know what to do, and I feel bad for him. All she tells me is ""I miss him"" and ""I still love him"". My best friend has made it clear that he is not still interested in her.

She adds stress to the group whenever he's around, and there's nothing we can do to help. This has been going on for 5 weeks since the breakup, and I can't deal with it anymore. Me and my best friend agreed that we should break ties with her, even though it seems immoral (Just to clarify; she would still be hanging out with the rest of the group, but me and my best friend wouldn't be there when she is)

WIBTA if I break ties with her?

TL;DR
My best friend broke up with a girl I had known for a long time. He found her too clingy and wanted to break it off soon to avoid making things worse for both of them. She was severely impacted by this and constantly mentions how she still has feelings for him, even though my best friend told her he isn't interested anymore. She still hangs out with our group of friends but she always brings the mood down and starts crying. This has been going on for a few weeks now, and I can't take the stress of trying to cheer her up anymore.",False,no assholes here,7,9,0
arh80p,1550378764,WIBTA for quitting my job?,"Okay, the reason I’m posting this is because I have mixed results from my coworkers and friends. I’m on mobile, so sorry for any issues. TLDR @ bottom

Some backstory; I’m a 16 y/o shift manager at a fast food chain. Over the summer I was working 50-60 hours a week, and when school started I said I can only work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. This was obviously a blow to the management team, which consists of two full time managers (GM and AGM) and then another part time student who only works Sunday . 

Here is where the controversy comes in. I want to quit very badly. The reason is that I asked off 2 weeks ago for this coming Friday because I have finals this week (my school runs trimesters, weird right?) and I want to work on papers that are due at midnight. So my manager, when doing the schedule last thursday, got mad at me and told a coworker that she’s going to schedule me for Wednesday because i shouldn’t have asked off for a day that I usually work. 

Well, I’m screwed now because I have finals and a presentation due on Thursday and I will be working to ~11 Wednesday night, when I specifically said at the beginning of the school year I couldn’t work schooldays. My coworkers are saying I’d be an douche because I would leave the management stranded with no closer for Friday thru Sunday, especially seeing that we are starting to get busy now that the weather is picking up. 

TLDR: GM got mad at me because I asked off for a day I usually work because I have finals, so she schedules me a close in the middle of finals week.  Our management team would be fucked if I left, but I want to quit.

I was alright with dough because he was joes friend, but then he started doing very rude stuff at my house. We had the Nintendo switch out playing smash, and every time he lost he would throw the controller down to the carpet.

No one else was doing that, and he kept just throwing it to the ground like if it was his stuff. We didn’t get too and because the ground was carpet, but we were annoyed nonetheless. 

Then later in the night, he kept opening his beers on my WOODEN furniture. He def dented my table and some other things. I was not ok with this. I mean, the table wasn’t really mine, it was a house mates, and the same for the other furniture, so I called him out. 

Despite that, he kept doing it, so inicie decided to take the beers away from the party and just leave the canned ones to avoid confrontation. 

Later, he was talking about how some beers he brought sucked, and then I jokingly replied, “yeah they suck” and he got extremely defensive about it. He kept saying “fuck you” and “what did you say bro,” and then he squared up to my face.  I told him to gtfo of my house and he said he wouldn’t. 

That’s when I got mad and I decided to hold his fists because I did not want to fight.  I then told him to gtfo, and I then pushed  him all the way through the hall way through out the door because he kept pushing me and trying to free his hands like he was going to punch me. 

When I got to the door, he pushed against the wall and tried pushing me down, but I remember all the wrestling from hs loll and just flipped him to the floor. 

Now I know there are no rules in fight, but while I had him in the floor, he kept trying to bite me. I just grabbed his head and pushed it to the floor to keep him from actually biting me. 


I then lifted him and literally threw him out the door. His friend left shortly after. He was  “sorry”.

My husband and I both work long hours at fairly stressful jobs during the week, so lately I've started wishing that I had more of our own / my own free time to relax on the weekends.

c5gpan,1561501934,WIBTA for blocking my ex after taking my car from her driveway,"About 2 years ago, I took on a lease to get a car for an ex of mine. Loan is in my name so it's my property. We split up about 3 months after this happened and the breakup was messy, I basically kicked her out of the apartment after giving a couple of weeks to pack her belongings. She had a kid, no job, and had to find a place to live, so I figured I would at least let her keep the car until she got back on her feet.

After a few months she got a job and started paying me back for the monthly payments on the lease. This worked pretty well for about a year. About 3-4 months ago she stopped paying me and said she was struggling financially. I figured it wouldnt take long for her to get back on track, but I've sent her multiple messages to seek payments and she has been either saying she needs more time or doesnt respond. Given knowledge of her behavior and personality, I'm positive she has no intentions of paying for the car and is hoping I'm too lazy and nonconfrontational to do anything about it.

I've decided I'm ready to get my car back so I can sell it and use some of my money to pay off the lease. She has the only copy of the keys, so I will go to the dealership I purchased the car at and have another copy of the keys made. After this I will probably show up in the middle of the night to her neighborhood and use the keys to unlock the car and drive out of her driveway. I would leave any bulky items in front the house and drive off.

At this point I'm ready to cut the ex out so I can move on with my life. Obviously losing the car would be a big deal for the ex as it's her main mode of transportation and would affect if she needs to take her child anywhere or get to work. However she has made no effort to obtain a cheaper car and return mine so this is my only option. Since I had lent her the car willingly I dont think this would qualify as a stolen vehicle and police wont get involved in civil matters. Also the car is worth more than 10k, so this is beyond the scope of small claims court and I have no interest in the headache of taking this to civil court.

Once I have the car I was hoping to block my ex's number and other social media accounts. I would send her a brief message that I would return the rest of her belongings on my way to work the very next day or the day after, and then block her again. The only thing I can think of is if I dont say anything initially, she will obviously freak out and may think the car has been stolen (I doubt she would make the leap of logic that I had spare keys made or would tow the car myself), and I dont know how mean it would be to let her freak out about that.

A close relative (CR) and I stayed at her house. We were trying to settle an inheritance in which Mean Uncle (MU) stiffed us for a huge sum of money. This is important.

I always loved my aunt, because she wasn't involved in the fighting, and her son and I have always been closerthanthis. This time though I noticed a painting hanging in the living-room. An old Jewish man in a black suit and payes holding a bag of money surrounded by more bags. I asked her what it was about, and she told me it was meant to bring money into the house. I told her that it was anti-Semitic and explained why. CR was also in the room but said nothing. 

I told CR how hurtful this was in private (my dad was a Holocaust survivor but he wasn't religious). CR told me I was overreacting and they couldn't bring up the matter as we were guests and said aunt had a nervous condition. But CR saw nothing wrong in bringing MU over knowing there would be fighting, because there always has been. My aunt had nothing to do with the inheritance. She and MU haven't even spoken as adults, and they live in the same city.

I tried to raise the matter several times in a polite way, explaining why this was hurtful, but all I got out of it was my aunt showing me pictures of random people she knew, asking me to tell her if they were Jewish, and talking about her homeland the way overly zealous patriots will talk about the Fatherland, minus the tears. My mother was born there, so they kind of consider me a local in a way, and for the most part it really is a nationalistic cess pool. That painting was everywhere in that area, sold on markets, and in souvenir stores. I was so mad, I got into it with a woman selling them, and the outcome was CR siding with the woman and the woman saying, ""I have Jewish friends. They never said a word.""

I haven't spoken to my aunt since we left, and it's been quite a few years. Haven't told her son, because he idolizes his mother, and to be perfectly honest I'm scared of finding out he's the same. He's more open-minded, and less patriotic, but commented the rampant Anti-Semitic in his country with, ""I believe it was the Jews who killed Jesus, but I don't believe they should still be punished for it.""

So my friend invited me over to his dorm to cook with him, he picked me up because he lives on the opposite side of campus. and even with layers of jackets walking outside was literally a nightmare because it was like -15 out and we had CRAZY high winds. after we parked we had to walk for 4 minutes to get to his dorm and when i got to his dorm i felt like i was freeze dried.

I ask my friend if he could offer him a ride and he goes “no, i’m not letting a stranger in my car” I tell him, “please he could die from the temperature” and my friend goes “i’m not letting a stranger in my car, he’s dumb for going out like that” and he literally drove away.

This series of events let me a bit depressed since I hardly speak with my brothers in person and I had to leave a bunch of friends behind that lead to me Losing contact with them but after moving into a medium sized town called Mariana and staying there for 4 years(The town where I got two of my cats that includes the old one), my parents again decided to move to a big city nearby called Belo Horizonte in Which I am living in right now and it has been about 4 months since I moved here. This whole process has left me really depressed with the cultural shock and the major changing of things. I had my life planned out from doing until year 2 of highschool here and doing the rest in Australia to do uni there and join the army but the News of moving to a new continent and leaving everyone I know behind including one of my cats that I am unseparable from since he pratically comforts me and reduces my anxiety left me angry since Whenever I try to argue about it my parents Just laugh it off and say I'll change my mind when I go there.

cscw4e,1566193816,AITA For considering not giving my daughter money for her surgeries.,"Throwaway

My wife and I are considered lower middle class and have three children 24,16 and 11. Three years ago, our oldest came out to us as transgender. We told her we would help in any way to ease her transition. She said she had everything covered since she already finished school, moved out of our home, working a decent job and had considerable savings. She had already spoken to her insurance company about coverage, seen a doctor about starting HRT and was seeing a therapist. I felt she had things in order, but my wife had the foresight to start putting money aside for my daughter, so we could help reduce any future costs.

Two years ago, my daughter moved to a more friendly LGBTQ+ city for better job opportunities and to have a more expanded community. Last year, she opened a second Instagram account and would post about expensive trips she was taking with her boyfriend and friends. My wife and I grew suspicious and asked about how she was paying for the trips. She explained she saved for the trips and her boyfriend was helping to pay. Since she is an adult, we didn’t dig deeper.

A week ago, my daughter came home for my 50th birthday and told us that she was ready to start scheduling her surgeries. Insurance will cover bottom surgery. However certain ones like, breast augmentation and surgery to gain a feminine face and body are considered cosmetic and are not covered.

When asked about how she attended to pay for these, she said that she wanted us to pay for everything.

My wife told her about the money that was set aside which amounts to about $4000. My daughter said she needed over $40 grand for the surgeries and possibly more to cover her living expenses, since she won’t be working while she recovers. We asked about the money she saved. She lied and said it wasn’t enough. When pushed more, she broke down and admitted that she had no more saving and that she was in debt. The city she moved to had a higher cost of living then she expected, plus the trips she took were financed by her savings, credit cards and payday loans.

I told her we were not in a position to give her $40 grand, but the money that was saved could go towards her debt. She cried and reiterated she needed the full $40 grand or she would never be a real woman. My wife and I tried to come up with reasonable solutions, but my daughter kept insisting for the full amount. At some point, my wife told her that she was being selfish for not thinking about her siblings who still need our support. The two argued and my daughter eventually stormed out of the house.

Now I’m at a crossroads, I am considering getting a second job to help my daughter and so she doesn’t do anything she’ll regret, but then again, I feel that she needs to learn my wife and I can’t fix everything. AITA

cm71t5,1564984117,"AITA for having my dog inside, even though my flatmate's door doesn't shut?","This feels like such a strange situation, but I need some input from someone outside the house.


I moved into a new shared house at the start of July, with 3 existing flatmates. I have a 2 year old, otherwise very well behaved, mixed breed dog. I mean, he's as close to perfect as possible. We train in agility, obedience, and dog sports, visit rest homes, and he's calm, quiet and has no other issues.


My other 2 flatmates have no issue with my dog. One is ambivalent, the other adores him. The flatmate in question, however, I'll call T. T has a background with dogs in this house - I've been told she had a border collie puppy whom she kept outside without shelter, which was taken away by the council for howling constantly. This all happened before I moved in. She is of the opinion that dogs should be outside, but she agreed when I moved in that my dog was an inside dog.


Now, T's door doesn't fit in the frame. This hasn't been a major issue for her apparently, but it means that the door is not able to be fully closed. I also have recently discovered, T has a habit of leaving food on her floor. Generally, I watch my dog whenever he is free in the house, and he stays in my room when I'm out. I admit that there are times I've left my door open while studying and kept an ear out, but he's never been destructive or much of a nuisance so I thought all was well. I also assumed that by leaving the door open, my flatmate didn't have anything dangerous in her room. 


I got a message from T over the weekend that my dog had been going through the bin and the food in her room and had eaten the chocolate base of a pie she'd left on the floor. She said this had been an ongoing issue and that he'd been pushing his way in, and that I needed to stop him from going in. My thought process is that if she refuses to shut her door, she needs to accept that my dog can get in there and not leave dangerous food on the floor, at least until I can work with him on boundary training at her door. The situation has escalated and I've reached a bit of an impasse here with T, so Reddit, AITA?

Boyfriend just bought a new house that we live in together. It was perfectly move-in ready but he wanted to do several construction projects that were invasive and messy. As a result, the space is quite a wreck and has been for a month.


 I just wrapped a week long contract job that was very emotionally and physically draining. During the time that I was on this contract job I was away from the house from early in the morning until very late into the evenings and even spent the night on location a time or two. I have been quite exhausted. I guess boyfriend has used this time to clean up the mess and get things done. Connected the washer and dryer, started painting ceilings.

Boyfriend and I carved out a little bit of time to have tea and spend time together during this job. It was then that he expressed that he feels that I am running myself ragged and then running out of energy for our relationship. I expressed that I am very tired but can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I expressed that I needed to complete some things, get my bearings and then I'd have more time to focus on house things. The contract job ended today and I will be getting an extended break from my actual job in about 3 weeks.

I thought that boyfriend understood my level of exhaustion until he asked me to please come home from the end of this contract job today and tape off the ceilings so that he/we could paint tonight. I initially expressed that I knew I would be tired and he said that I didn't need to tape off the ceilings. I felt guilty and unsupportive so I begrudgingly said I'd do it.

He texted me today as I am running around for this job and suggested that tonight we make dinner together (our stove is not even plugged in...our dishes are not unpacked, the cabinet doors aren't even on) drink wine and paint the ceilings. I was initially pretty pissed because we had JUST discussed how taxing things had been and that I was just a few weeks away from having more time. And I was annoyed that he couldn't wait a single day to start working on projects. And annoyed that this seemed more important than spending quality time together, though we would be spending time together while painting ceilings.

I didn't say anything about it because I thought that I was maybe being overly emotional or difficult. But when he got home I was pretty upset and let him know that I thought he was being pretty unempathetic by piling work onto my plate the very evening I had wrapped this job.

This devolved into an argument when all I wanted was an evening off and for him to acknowledge that he had been kind of insensitive.

My wife's pregnant half sister went into labour on Friday, so my wife dropped everything (including cancelling the marriage counselor) and decided to go help out. She planned this without telling me, although I knew there was a chance she would go. I don't begrudge her going at all, because we desperately needed help when we were pregnant, and this was a time to help others. We only have one car, so she waited for me to come home from work Friday afternoon and left pretty soon after. She took our two eldest children with her (my stepchildren) and left our two toddlers with me - so she could take the eldest to see their grandparents who lived locally to my wife's half sister, all about 3 hours away.


She promised (pinky promised!) she'd be back in time on Sunday to share Father's Day with me, and so that all our children could be together for me. She even said she'd be back in time to prepare a father's Day meal for me. I was looking forward to this because for the last two years I've had to be away for work on father's Day.


I had a pleasant enough weekend at home with our two youngest, but it's never the same when half your family is gone. I got plenty of message from my wife saying she missed us etc.


My wife returned home around 7pm Sunday evening and almost immediately walking from the car she said ""oh I'm too tired to cook you dinner"". When I said she could have given me warning that I needed to make other arrangements she said she'd been too busy to tell me. 


She then got herself some snacks to eat, let the two eldest get their own food, and I ended up cooking and eating my own father's Day meal by myself. Any other day this would not really be an issue, but I felt sad and aggrieved that she would be so indifferent to my feelings on father's Day. However, when I tried asking her about it, she went on about how I never think about her feelings, and that I've missed other family occasions before (I'm in the military and away a lot).


Does it make me the asshole for reading too much into this? Should I just let it go? When I think about it, it doesn't seem a bit deal, but then it does.

So I'm travelling back home from an out-of-town wedding and I bought tickets with one of those airlines that don't have assigned seats. I was in the last boarding group so I was amazed when I saw an open window seat near the front of the plane and nabbed it. There were two older women sitting in the middle seat and the aisle seat in the same row. When I asked them to let me in to the row they both gave a big sigh and were obviously not happy to let me in, but hey it's a plane right? No one's really happy on a plane. I didn't think much of it.

The flight was about 4.5 hours long so I settled in, no issues yet. As we are about 45-50min away we can see some of the city we're landing in, but we're still on top of the clouds and it's super bright in my eyes. I stick it out for a bit but eventually have to lower the shade because the sun in bouncing off the clouds and is just uncomfortable for me. A minute or so after I close the shade the lady next to me taps me on the shoulder (I had headphones on) and asks that I re-open the shade. I politely tell her sorry, the sun is really bright in my eyes so I won't open it back up, put my headphones back on and think that's it. The lady taps me again on the shoulder and angrily informs me that they paid money for the flight and to open my window. I again say sorry, not going to do it, and next thing I know she's leaning over me trying to open the shade. By instinct I block her arm I turned to her and say ""sorry, if you wanted to see out the window you should have sat in this seat"" She looks shocked that I had blocked her arm and starts to protest again and I say again, ""if you wanted the window you should have sat in this seat"", and put my headphones back on. 

Here's the part where I'm not sure if I am TA - I had been planning on putting the shade back up once we were out of the cloud bank, but being petty I decided not to. If she hadn't have gotten angry or literally thrust her arm across my body I probably would have re-opened it for them. I feel like she had the opportunity to guarantee an open window and she chose not to take it.

But then my brother and his gf bring a platter of gifts, a few of them definitely being very expensive. I told my mom I felt a little weird for not getting her anything, she said it was fine but my brother and gf were very disapproving of me. They gave me weird looks and acted very condescending. In the past other family has also expressed their feelings towards me not buying my parents gifts, they think its inappropriate/asshole-ish of me.

His memory problems are so bad that while we were at the hospital yesterday he forgot several times why we were there, told the nurse the wrong problem, and asked why we made him have an IV while sitting in surgery pre-op. He's not aware of the next surgery he has to schedule because he's forgotten it from yesterday.

I explained to him that he is my stepdad, and that ive never met my real dad. I explained to him we are still the same and still brother and sister and that it doesnt make a difference. He told me that all makes sense and he wouldnt tell anyone. 

It was all good and it felt good to tell him as i never talk about the situation to anyone. Yesterday i told my mom that i told him and she got livid. She told me it was not my place whatsoever, and that he was way to young to hear about that. She said i was completley out of line and its her job not mine. I told my mom that shes hardly told me anything about the other side of my family so thats not fair and he had a right to know. Its about me and not her. But shes so mad. Shes always been super sensitive on the topic of my dad and gets so emotional about it that i never ask anymore even though i strongly want to meet the other side of my family 

I havent talked to her about it but now that i think about it, it is her son and if she thinks he shouldn't have known then maybe he shouldnt have known. I think he is fine. He isnt scarred or sad or confused. I felt like he was plenty old and mature. We tell each other everything anyway. But did i go too far?

Edit: Im his big sister

ciaq8h,1564186646,WIBTA if I leave my dad without a car 30 minutes from home because he is giving blood?,"So, this is more for the rest of my family then myself but here we go. 
At the start of the week my dad decided he would be giving blood. He didn’t say where and he mentioned when but in broad strokes like “at the end of the week” 
Today I (and the rest of the driving members of my family) receive a call from my dad asking us to drive to a town thirty minutes away to pick him up. 
While this is certainly an inconvenience, especially since my sister is back in town for all of 2 days and we are spending that time driving we decide to help him out. 
Upon arriving, we discover that he is only just starting the process and then he ghosts us as we drive around looking for him/ a location to eat. As we approached the hour mark of this journey the discussion turned to just driving home and leaving my dad to his own devices.

cb92bh,1562716923,AITA for sunbathing nude on my own property?,"I am an overweight mid-30s woman.  I enjoy being nude outside, not for sexual reasons, but like an old hippie. I live in a city apartment so cannot go nude outside. I go home to my parent's lake house 2-3 times a year, and if my family and their direct neighbors are not home, I will usually go outside naked starting around dusk, having a nice naked bonfire or sitting on the dock in the dark.  My parents are aware that I do this and have no issue with it - and I warn them if the deer-sighting camera goes off unexpectedly so they can delete the evidence.

Today, however, it was just a beautiful day out and I wanted to do some sunbathing.  I'm usually home in the cooler months so can't partake in this.  I brought a chair and a book out to the firepit, lit a fire, and reclined in the sun.  The house is on a semi-private lake (public boat access, no public beaches, no-wake rule so only fishing boats really) and is located in a small bay.  There are 4 houses in the bay; ours is the third one in.  There are only two spots in the yard you can really see the lake right now because of the trees - directly off the dock, and a clearing about 6 feet wide that points out to the main lake.  The bay is shallow and full of weeds; in 10 years, I've only ever seen one person fishing in it.  The area across from the houses is marshy and uninhabited.  The clearing is small enough and the bay is remote enough that I assumed people wouldn't see me - you're usually not looking onto the shore when you're fishing.  

I guess I was wrong though!  When I went to set up my fire, I noticed I could see a fishing boat through the clearing, and I know the ""if you can see them, they can see you"" line of thought, so I got my fire and everything ready with my towel still on, and didn't remove it until I was reclined in the chair, with my back directly towards the clearing so minimal visual access.  At that time the boat was no longer there.  About 20 minutes later, I heard a motor and looked, and the same boat was back in the clearing - far enough out that I couldn't see faces but close enough that I could tell there were 2 middle-age men in the boat.  I drifted back to sleep.  A short time later, I heard the 'klunk' of something hitting my dock, so I sat up confused and grabbed my towel.  

It was the same fishing boat, who had motored over to yell at me.  They said it was illegal for me to be naked outside; I said no, I'm on my own private property, and our state doesn't have rules against it anyway.  They said they found it distracting while they were fishing, I said sorry but that's not my fault, and they said they were going to report me to the DNR for interfering with their fishing.  I shrugged and said sorry, hope you have a better day, and out of politeness gathered my things and went inside.  They boated away and I haven't seen them on the lake since.

I don't feel I did anything wrong, and I tried to be respectful (covered when walking around, faced my chair away from the lake), but AITA for being naked outside today?",False,not the asshole,527,128,0
bdnzga,1555377637,AITA for selling my house that I bought with my inheritance money if my mom is upset about it,"3 years ago, my adoptive mom helped me buy a house with my inheritance from when my adoptive dad passed away.  I was told by her that this was my inheritance and that when I was ready to sell it and move somewhere else she would be fine with it. Now she is listed as the secondary owner just in case anything happened to me.  So she has to sign off on anything to do with selling the house unfortunately. Recently I decided it was time for me to move on with my life and sell the house so my fiancee and I can buy our first house together.  He's putting just as much into this as I am but my mom has done nothing but throw roadblocks in our plans. At first she was refusing to sign but after several conversations signed the papers to list the house. At this point she was saying it was her money and not my inheritance like she originally said. As the primary owner the money from the house will go to me though. Today I approved an offer for the house and now need her to sign more papers confirming the sale before the final closing paperwork. When I called to let her know, she said I can't have all the money from the sale. She's saying I can only have about half. I'm upset about the whole thing because we had plans for every bit of the money we get from the sale. Every time I talk to her she acts like I owe her for taking me in as a child. Am I the asshole for wanting to sell the house and keep all the money?

TLDR; I want to sell my house but my mom refuses to let me without taking half the money or refusing to sign even though it's my inheritance money that bought the house

Update on how this all panned out: unfortunately she did take half the money from the sale of the house and we have not spoken since signing the closing papers.  Me and the other half ended up getting a domestic partnership before buying our new house so we are both protected in case of one of us leaving the other for those of you who were concerned about me and my boyfriend buying a home together. We were still able to buy the place we wanted and we just closed on it a little under a week ago so we are doing fine even with everything that happened with this whole ordeal.

I assume either my friend or his mother will text me once they land at the airport. 1 hour later i text his mom anyways to let her know that they can just text me when they land and I´ll be there in 15 minutes, they'll have to go through baggage claim anyways so the wait won't be too long.

I then receive a call from my friends mother telling me they already landed and have been waiting for me for 15 minutes and she seems a little triggered so i get my hurry on and drive to the airport.

Once I get there they have been at the airport for 30 minutes and are a bit triggered but i took them home and received 20 dollars for the 1 hour and 30 minutes ride.

I am just unsure if I am the asshole for letting them wait at the airport, or his mother is the asshole for guilt tripping me when i only drove them home to be nice (20 dollars isn't really much in Denmark)

butr99,1559226060,AITA for not wanting to be disturbed while watching TV?,"A little bit of a rant because this just keeps happening.

For context - I don't live with my parents anymore, but I'm visiting them at least twice a month because they're my parents and I like hanging out with them.

They own a pretty neat TV system so sometimes I when I visit them I plopp down on the couch and enjoy some Netflix in my pyjamas. 

Now to my issue: My mom likes to sit down next to me and watch parts of the movie with me, I enjoy that. But on more than one occasion, she just does loud things, including turning her phone to 'loud mode' so you can hear every tip and notification on her cell phone, she has phone conversations while sitting there, she watches videos people send her on whatsapp.
And everytime I told her: I don't mind you being on the phone while watching a movie with me but just try to be quiet so I can focus, and everytime she tells me ""you're being a mean and egoistic person for saying so""

Today she hit the final straw by bringing her laptop and watching minute long recordings from old family holidays. I repeatedly asked her to either put headphones in or turn it down, or, if it's important to her, watch it in her room, or even wait until the movie is over so I can watch them with her, to which she again, replied ""you can be so mean sometimes"" and ""it's my house so I can do what I want"" and ""why is this such a problem it's not like you can't see the movie anyway?""

I didn't think I was being mean, I just told her I think it's really impolite to do that while someone is watching a movie (especially since it was one of my favorites, planet of the apes, which she knows!)

She's currently not talking to me because of that and I seriously considering going back to my place because the mood is ice cold because of that.

So, TL;DR:  WIBTA by repeatedly asking my mom not to be loud in her house while I was watching a movie?

Edit: I appreciate that all of you took the time to respond - sometimes you think your view on things is the right and pragmatic one even though it isn't.

I'd just like to clarify something that was brought up in the comments: No, I don't visit my parents just to watch TV. Most of the time is filled with talking, eating together and asking how everyone has been. The movie watching is something I generally do in the evenings, when everyone kind of does their own thing.

This doesn't change that my behaviour was apparently rude, so i'll try to talk to her and apologize.

There's never been a case of anything bad happening at the parties that kids from my school go to.

I argued that it wasn't fair that I couldn't go, as I'd be very careful not to let anything happen. I even told them that I wouldn't drink anything, and that I could be the designated driver for my friends. They still said no.

devpkq,1570512808,"AITA for smoking weed on my patio, even though it disturbs my neighbor?","I have been living in my apartment for a little over 6 months now. During this time I've had no problems sitting on my patio and enjoying a pipe or a joint. 

However, the family that lived above me moved out and was shortly after replaced by a young (mid 20s?) couple. The first time I saw them on the patio after they'd moved in, I said hello and introduced myself, the woman complimented my dog and that was that. Later on that night, I decide to bring my (small) bong outside for a short while. At this point, I'd heard them talking on their patio for a while, so I knew they were out there but I didn't think anything of it. Very shortly after I started smoking, one of them said something and they both started laughing and went inside. I thought ok whatever. But since then, every time I walk by and anyone's on the patio they'll ignore me when I wave, and whenever I go on the patio while they're out there they immediately go inside (sometimes even when I'm not even going out to smoke, it's like they just don't want to be around to even risk it).

So it seems pretty obvious to me that the smoking bothers them, since our introduction was so positive and everything since has been really strange and icy. While I know that I'm not breaking any rules (legal in my state and confirmed with the apartment when I first moved in that it was a smoking community) and am allowed to do what I'm doing, I kind of feel bad going out when I know they've been outside enjoying a chat for a while. But at the same time I've been here much longer and it's always been fine, so I don't want to have to change my habits for their sake, especially since they haven't said anything directly to me and instead have been a little rude about it.

ayf4ec,1551979433,AITA for not letting my mother move in with me and my bf?,"So, a little bit of background. My mother and my stepdad recently purchased a property in my city, where my mother plans on living in a tiny house. However, in addition to the tiny house, she would need a permanent address, as well as a place to do laundry, shower and store her things. Also, when it gets too cold in the winter she would live there. So, my parents have been looking for a suitable place (it ought to be ideally freshly renovated) for a really low price. So far they haven't had much luck.

Today my mother called me to make me an ""offer"". She wants to come to my place to shower and do laundry 3x a week and live here a maximum of 2 months per year. In exchange, she wants to give me her expensive new living room furniture and a new kitchen, (which are things she insits on having in my flat, even though I have a kitchen and furniture which I would have to throw out). Also, because my flat is not up to her standards, she wants to renovate it (put in new tiles, paint etc.). Now, we did not intend on renovating the flat and also don't need furniture, however in exchange for these things she would like to have my bf's current bedroom rent free for the first 9 months and then pay 50% at the beginning of next year.

Now, if my bf and I had intended to renovate the flat and needed new furniture this would be a great deal, but honestly living in a pile of rubble for months while they renovate my flat and then having my mother come live with us for two months in the winter just doesn't strike me as a good deal. My bf and I love living alone, since this is the first time we are able to live without additional roommates. Also our flat is quite small and my mother does not work, which means in the winter she might be here for two months constantly. She also wants to bring her cat, who is used to being outside 12 hours a day, and she can't go outside where we live.

I thought my parents would understand that the deal they were offering me just wasn't that good for me. Yes, the furniture is expensive but I don't need expensive furniture and I can live in this flat without fresh paint on the walls. However, when I told them no just now they said that they were ""extremely disappointed"", because they apparently thought I would jump at this offer. Now, I feel like I am being harsh telling them that I don't want to live with my mother, even if it is only two months a year tops. So AITA?

I leaned long ago never to tell a woman she looks fat or that clothing makes her look as such. Usually when presented with the ""does it make me look fat"" question, I avoid it and find something else wrong with the outfit (clashing colors, too racy for work, not your style, etc. etc.)  This morning my wife asked me if a blue summer dress made her look fat.  I sidestepped and said ""I like that dress, it matches your eyes.""  The dress is one of those with the seam directly below the bosom.

At lunch, a female acquiescence hailed us and asked if my wife was expecting. My wife said no and then started crying after the encounter.  I held her and said I was sorry that had happened.  She then called me an asshole for not telling her to NOT wear the dress and said ""And you probably agree that I look pregnant.""

We've had our arguments but always come out the other side. When we were teenagers we were never apart. We were always out drinking, partying, shopping etc. Over the past 7 years we have drifted as I'm not in to that lifestyle anymore yet she is and she has done mannnnny questionable things such as having an affair and has always used me as her cover story without me knowing until a day or so after. Around a year ago, she rings me absolutely petrified, saying she thinks she is pregnant. I reassured her that whatever her decision, she would be absolutely fine and that I'll help her in any way that I can. A week later she calls and says that the news has settled in and she's keeping the baby. I congratulate her. We didn't see each other much during her pregnancy but kept in touch often. I helped to organise her baby shower with her other best friend and spent a fair amount of money on the shower and present. The whole time I was there I was made to feel really awkward and as if I'd been invited just because we had been friends for so long, not because we are actually friends. I kept asking to see her scan pictures as she'd been for a 3D scan and she kept brushing it off but then I saw her showing other people. I made my excuses and left after about 2 hours. I messaged her a few days later and no reply. I continued to attempt contact every few days for the next 9 weeks until I went on Facebook one day and saw that her baby boy had been born 3 weeks early, 3 weeks prior to her posting her news on Facebook. This absolutely knocked the wind out of me because I was finding out on Facebook that my best friend had given birth 3 weeks earlier and I had no clue about it. I still to this day have not had a response from her and I have not liked/commented etc on any of her posts since therefore by default, I have not acknowledged the baby.

I don’t mind visiting cause usually we can have fun going out or just hanging out. 

My wife’s relationship with her mother is complicated. She loves her as she is her mother, but can only stand her negative and paranoid personality outlook on life for a limited timeframe. I’m no therapist, but I believe there are some deep rooted mental issues(extreme depression, and maybe even schizophrenia, I have no clue). 

Now her sisters relationship with her own mother is toxic. There is no civility between them and I’m guessing hasn’t been for a very long time. The daughter treats her mom like shit but this has definitely been brought on by her parents enabling her and giving everything she wanted because if she didn’t, she would sulk,cry and eventually get angry, until her parents would just give in to her wishes. 

Now this weekend we plan on visiting since it is my wifes birthday, we our getting our 3D ultrasound done and she is also going to a concert with her sister. Her mother also plans to visit for some of her own medical appointments. She usual stays at her daughters apartment as she is still paying for it.

I just started talking to my ex again a few months ago. It was an emotionally abusive relationship. We both hurt each other a lot. It’s been a few years and I got over it, and so did he.  We talk strictly as acquaintances, and we talk a few times a week. That’s it. The other day, he came to me to vent about his new gf and their problems. He asked me to not bring up our past. I said I wouldn’t . I listened to him and offered advice on what to do. I told my boyfriend and he got upset. I even offered to show him the messages to reassure him. He said no and just continued looking upset. Now whenever I’m on my phone, he looks at what I’m doing to see if I’m talking to him. I don’t mind that because i don’t want to hide anything from him. I feel like it’s not right to talk to my ex and to respect my current relationship, but at the same time I want to help my ex and see him improve. I just want the best for him. Am i the asshole?

bk9abq,1556894746,AITA for being mad at my parents for being uninterested grandparents?,"Growing up, I had amazing grandparents. They were super involved in our lives, babysat regularly, and had sleepovers at their house all the time. They even took us on a couple trips. This was my normal. As I got older, my parents made comments about looking forward to being grandparents some day and after I got married, they were always wondering when a baby was coming (not in an obnoxious way). They even put in a pool in their back yard to “prepare for the next stage of life.”

Then, I had a baby. Comments made by them in the past had me thinking that my mom would be willing to watch the baby while I worked part time. She said she didn’t feel up to it, and thought daycare would be a better fit. Sure, ok. Then, I’d call and ask them to babysit for whatever reason, and they were usually busy, or not feeling well, or tired, or some other excuse. I tried talking to them about it, and they said “we enjoy babysitting, but we like spending time with all of you the most.” Ok...

My oldest is 10 now, and he has spent the night at their house once, and they have babysat probably 15 times total. When he was 3, his father and I divorced. The lack of babysitting and interest in his life wasn’t as noticeable because he was at his dad’s house half the time. I remarried and had another baby 2 years ago. The trend has continued. They see us about once every 2-3 months and have babysat twice. I asked if they could watch the kids while my husband and I went on a weekend getaway, and they said that they don’t think it would be a good idea. “It’s too tiring.” (They are still in their 50’s, and my dad is prepping now for his second marathon. They are more active and fit than I am.)

I’ve tried to accept that they are just not interested, but it’s hard. My friends all drop their kids off for weekends with grandma all the time. My mom’s best friend hosts “camp grandma” once a year, complete with matching shirts and trips to theme parks. It’s so sad to me that my kids won’t ever get that.

cwuvs1,1567046369,AITA for not really celebrating my parents' anniversary?,"A bit of clarity: I don't refuse to acknowledge it or abstain from partaking in celebration entirely, however, my family has always kept all holidays and celebrations pretty low-key. Usually the standard celebration for any given holiday (xmas, bdays, etc) involves a gift + card and maybe dinner out. So as an adult, my approach to celebrating holidays is also very low-key. 

Their anniversary is coming up soon (it's not a milestone or anything) and as usual, we're going out to dinner as a family to celebrate. But my schedule conflicted with the actual date of their anniversary, so we moved the dinner to the following night because they wanted me to still join them for dinner, which is great!

But my dad called me and was agitated that now he has to wait an extra day to give mom her gift since I'm not there, and he said he'd sign her ""happy anniversary"" card from the both of us, and they've strongly implied I should be arriving with gifts as well and treating them to dinner.

They're like this every year, and they always get offended when I don't arrive with a gift from me to each of them separately, or when I don't take the lead on the celebration by paying for their dinner, and I always felt weirded out when I'm made to sign the sentiment cards, which are overtly romantic and explicitly directed to the person you're *married* to. 

The thing is, I don't feel like it's my place. This isn't ""my"" celebration; I am not really part of it. An anniversary is about the two people who have married each other, and their enduring relationship. It's fine for them to include me in their celebration, as I am family and I have no problem joining them for dinner and wishing them a happy anniversary, but mainly it should be between and about the two of them. 

So, I don't feel it's appropriate to give my mother an anniversary gift from myself, because I'm not the one married to her! I don't think I should be expected to give a card, nor does my name have any place as a signature on the ones they give to each other. My presence has no bearing on when they exchange their gifts, and while I suppose my buying their dinner would be a generous gesture on my part, they always choose expensive steakhouses and such that are way out of my budget, as a broke college student, and aren't willing to compromise. Plainly put, I can't afford steak-and-lobster dinners for 3. 

Yet, they frequently take the position that I'm being aloof and selfish and it's *their* ""special day"" so I should be doing what they want and making it special for them! I think that even if I am a result of their marriage, I have nothing to do with their marriage, and it should be enough that I acknowledge their anniversary (""Happy anniversary!"") and accept their invitation to dinner, since it has been awhile since I saw them. We dont always have the best relationship so perhaps I'm letting their other antics in my life color my perspective on what I think is appropriate social protocol for celebrating other people's anniversaries, but AITA after all?",False,not the asshole,7,8,0

Five years ago I met my sister's (Linda) husbands (James) brother (Mark) at my sister's and her then fiance's engagement party. Mark was my dream man I didn't act on my attraction however, we just engaged in polite conversation and friended each other on facebook. I didn't see Mark again until the wedding and at the reception, we really hit it off we drank and danced together all night long all in all it was a night to remember. Later we connected on facebook and went on a date.

Family members were initially worried simply because if things went awry it could possibly result in family drama but Mark and I shrugged off their concerns, we figured we were both mature enough to deal with a break up amicably if the time ever came but we both thought that our relationship would last forever. But...unfortunately, our relationship started to break down. When I moved in with Mark in 2017 that's when money really started to become an issue for both of us.

To make a long story short: I started finding myself frustrated with Mark's poor spending habits and financial planning but I thought things would get better once he moved in and I would be able to guide his spending habits. That's not how it worked out, we argued a lot over finances and that's when the breakdown of our relationship truly started.

In 2018 I noticed Mark had become more distant toward me. He was on his phone *a lot* during this time which I was concerned about because he was never the type of man to use his phone constantly. In October things came to a head when I saw him tagged in some risque photos on Instagram of him at a Halloween party with some woman I had never seen before, when I confronted him about it he admitted to cheating and apologized profusely but I was done I told him to pack his shit and leave and that I never wanted to see him again. I never saw Mike again until July of this year (2019.)

I had told my parents about Mark so I didn't quite expect him to be there but low and behold I see him with Linda and James laughing it up and drinking a beer.

I would say, as a parent, I am fairly lenient when it comes to what my children do in their spare time. Both my son (12) and my daughter (14) are still on summer break right now, and don’t go back to school until mid-August, so for the past few weeks since we’ve got back from a trip, they’ve mostly been playing video games all day and watching tv on their rooms on their computers. This alone wouldn’t be the issue, as they’re pretty well-behaved otherwise and get off when I tell them to for things like family dinner.

Recently, however, I decided to check the internet reports from my internet provider online and discovered that my daughter’s phone and computer were using WiFi until past four in the morning. This, to me, is absolutely ridiculous, but when I confronted her about it, she said it didn’t matter if she was staying up that late since she woke up late, and therefore got a normal eight hours of sleep.

asduub,1550602211,AITA For not wanting to give up my job? Because GF is depressed.,"So my GF (30F) and me (31M) have been together for over 12 years now, and for most of her time with me she has suffered from depression on and off and has been manifesting itself in different ways every time.

Early in our relationship she wanted to become a teacher, I expressed my concern that It's mentally challenging but if shes really wants to i support her!

She goes though education 5 years, get a job and loves it and after 3 years crashes into a combination of depression and burnout.. First they tried half-time but it didn't help, panic attacks and anxiety started to manifest every other day so shes on sick-leave for 3 months and has no energy to do anything most days...In short.

Me I'm going to a different path, after a electrician education goes thru military training, get a temp-job as a security guard and stay there to clime up the ladder so i get a full-time job at the best position in the company it took 6 years to get where i am today.. And i love it! Basically I sit at a reception during nighttime and play video-games with friends thru internet and scroll reddit and netflix :D It's the most lazy job on the planet and because its all nighttime i make above average pay and more then any of my friends have.

The only downside I work every other weekend and is 12 hour shifts.

This means 2 weekend a month she is home alone with our kid and I'm only with my family a few hours, it tough but it's my job and I have come to accept it.

She however doesn't, she thinks i should take almost any job that includes daytime and no weekends.. regardless of pay or working environment. Just because she needs my support during weekends. I understand it's hard but should i sacrifice all that I've worked for?

She gets mad every time we talk about it and starts to tear up.

Am not all that against changing my job but i at least want a job that i might like or I'm worried I might get depressed.

I'm trying to support her the best i can when I'm not at work, making dinner, cleaning, laundry. etc. But some days i feel like I'm the only parent taking care of my kid and my GF and the household all alone..

AITA for not wanting to help her? Everyone i asked just says it's a hard one..

\*My kid is about to turn 3 years old.

bwslnt,1559675140,AITA for leaving a bad review after a refund?,"This happened a while ago but has been bugging me ever since. I bleached my hair and it was in bad condition. I booked an appointment at a hairdresser's. At the appointment I asked for my hair to be dyed my natural colour and cut short. I also asked for lowlights but didn't realise this wasn't possible and ended up not getting them (I maybe expected too much). During the appointment she complained repeatedly about my hair being in bad condition and I kept apologising. She didn't speak to me about anything else.  The hairdresser matched my hair but then when she dyed it my hair was too dark and too warm. The dye also didn't work on the ends so it looked awful, a half dye. The hairdresser said nothing so I paid and tipped her as I felt like I had been so much work from her complaining.

Over the week I used a shampoo toner to try and cool the colour but all that happened was the bleached parts turned purple. I called the salon and they told me the hairdresser was independent and it had to be her who fixed it (I later contacted the citizen's advice bureau and they confirmed that the salon should I have fixed it as I booked it through them). When I got there she roughly grabbed at my hair and then started laughing at how bad it looked.

I'm ashamed to say that I jumped up from sitting and snapped at her, asking why she was laughing. Someone else said it was because she was nervous but she had looked to be smirking to me. She offered to try to fix it but didn't seem very confident about it and said if she had dyed my hair my natural colour it would have gone green (but didn't say this when she dyed my hair or I would have done it myself). She claimed the dark colour would matched when it grew up but it was dark brown and my colour is dark blonde. I told her I had tipped her because she made me feel so bad but she just grabbed my hair and said ""but it is broken"" like it made it ok. I got a full refund (including tip) and angry glares as I left but no apology.

When I got back I was pretty upset about how she had treated me both times. I wrote a long review on their Facebook page and tried to be clear I was annoyed by the hairdresser's attitude and \*not\* the hairdye itself (I knew my hair was in bad condition). I also mentioned that I felt sorry for snapping at her. Immediately the hairdresser's friends reacted with angry faces and said I was lying and trying to ruin her business. I tried to respond to them but it just made it worse. They also left about ten separate positive reviews for the hairdresser with snide comments about ""people"" who have bleached hair. I got no reply from the hairdresser or salon. Eventually my account was locked and the review disappeared (it was a new account as I don't use facebook and with a fake name).

&#x200B;

I've wondered ever since if I was the asshole for snapping at her and then for leaving a negative review after being refunded. It seems everyone else really likes the hairdresser so I don't understand what happened with me.

cajo42,1562584058,AITA for sharing a bed with a 6 yr old?,"Throw away account, mobile, ECT. 

I (25M) babysit my roommate's niece, Amy, pretty often, like at least once or twice a month for the past 2 yrs now, I don't get paid for it as her parents have my roommate and I over for dinner pretty much every Sunday. I've known my roommate for almost 10 yrs, and I was practically raised in his house. We moved in together 3 yrs ago, we have a 2 bedroom apartment. 

On the 4th of July, my roommate's brother shows up to drop Amy off at our apartment, apparently my roommate was supposed to be babysitting this time around but he buggered off to his girlfriend's house, later claiming he forgot. So I offered to babysit instead. Amy's parents were throwing a bachelor's party at their house for a friend. They were supposed to pick Amy up at 11 PM, but there was a incident, cops got involved. They asked if she could stay the night at my house. I accepted. 

My roommate locks his bedroom door when he leaves because the latch doesn't work and my dogs (I have 3) will get in there and mess with his stuff, so his bed was out of the question. The living room only has 2 arm chairs and a bean bag chair, so neither of us could sleep in there. So we ended up in my king size bed together. With one of my dogs who suffers extreme separation anxiety, he's a sweetheart tho.

Apparently, I shouldn't have done this. I didn't think it would be a problem, I've bathed the child before, on multiple occasions, on orders from her parents. I've known her since she was born, I was at her christening. Anyway, now I'm being yelled at for it, my roommate also doesn't see an issue with it, but his SIL is absolutely furious.

arrlcp,1550453122,AITA for refusing to make my dad's phone calls?,"Growing up, my dad always treated me as his personal secretary. Usually, it was making phone calls for him. He'd never ask, he'd just say, ""Go get the phone and call Carl and tell him I can't come to his barbecue this weekend."" I HATED this, because I was very shy, and I'd always end up going back and forth between my dad telling me what to say and telling him what his buddy was saying on the phone, which was stressful as fuck (my parents also made me the messenger between them whenever they would fight, so this is a bit of a raw nerve). But of course, as a kid, I couldn't tell him no.

Important detail: My dad recently got a cell phone. He immediately taped over the selfie cam, claiming that the government would use it to spy on him, but then gets pissed when he tries to put the phone on speaker and can't because the proximity sensor keeps preventing him from pressing the button (the tape covers the sensor, and I've explained this several times). He refuses to use anything but speaker, because he believes having the phone near his head will cause cancer.

Anyway, today, I got a phone call from him while I was in the middle of cooking dinner. He told me his house phone wasn't working, and he wanted to find out if it was just his house or others. Then he said, ""I need you to call my workplace and my girlfriend and then call me back to tell me if the phones are working.""

This irritated the FUCK out of me, because I'm almost 30 and he's telling me--not asking me--to make these calls for him. I'm ESPECIALLY not comfortable with calling his girlfriend because 1) that's awkward as fuck, and 2) I've only met her in passing and spoken to her once.

That said, I was polite and said, ""Dad, no offense, but can you call them instead? You're already on the phone.""

He told me he couldn't because he didn't want to call and them hear him struggle with putting speaker on. I asked why he couldn't just keep speaker off, and I got the ""There's no way I'm putting this phone near my head.""

So I plainly said, ""Dad, I really don't want to call your girlfriend."" I started to explain that I was in the middle of something, but he cut me off and started SCREAMING at me. ""JESUS CHRIST, I'M ASKING YOU TO DO ONE LITTLE THING, BUT FINE, WHATEVER, I'LL DO IT LIKE I ALWAYS DO, AND I'VE HAD A REALLY SHITTY DAY, AND [proceeds to rant and rave about a bunch of things that have nothing to do with me making his calls for him].""

By the end of that, I decided maybe compromise was the best option (because his rant made me feel like an asshole), and I offered to call his work for him, but not his girlfriend. He didn't like that either, but eventually agreed. I hung up, called his work (it didn't connect), and then texted him to let him know. He wrote back about how he probably wouldn't be able to reach his girlfriend because of his phone issue but ""that's fine I guess."" (He did end up calling and getting a busy signal.)

Since I became an adult, I started telling him no when he'd ask tell me to do this kind of stuff, and everytime, he'd either be super passive aggressive towards me about it, or try to guilt trip me. That's why I didn't really react to his rant about his super stressful day. It's not just phone calls either... it's telling me to order him stuff online (because he doesn't want Amazon to have his address) or paying his phone bill for him (because he doesn't want the phone company to have his bank account/card number). I love my dad very much and would love to help him with stuff, but sometimes it's ridiculous. He does the whole ""I'll never ask for a favor again"" BS when I say no, but of course a week or so later, he's back to it.

AITA for saying no? :(

TL;DR - Dad doesn't ask but tells me (almost 30) to make phone calls for him like some sort of secretary, and becomes passive aggressive and guilt trips me when I say no.

Edit: Thanks for the feedback, everyone. I guess he's been successful in guilt tripping me, and you're right, I need to stop enabling this behavior. I appreciate the outside perspective.",1550486660.0,not the asshole,8,12,0

After I left, my friend got into the idea that he had to ""change"" the people who he considered bad. So his friends during that time, consisted of people who didn't study and used to drink (they were underage). During this time, he met a girl, who broken up with her boyfriend, after getting cheated on. He decided to ""help"" her by dating her. This lead to him getting cheated on by her with one of his friends. I think she justified it by saying she said she wanted revenge on men for what they did to her. His ""friends"" left him after a fight between him and the guy she cheated with. My friend, really heartbroken, went into ""depression"", and graduated with really terrible scores. He didn't get accepted into any college or university, and had to take a gap year.

During the gap year, he met another girl, and decided within a year of dating her that she'd be the one he'd marry. The girl also broke up with after four or five months of dating him. This pushed him down further, and his gap year didn't go well either, and his parents ended up paying his way into a college.

He actually lives closer to his work but makes an effort to come over for parties and dnd, and usually ends up crashing on our couch.

Now our dungeon master (Lets call him Bob) is a great dungeon master but a kinda control freak in all aspects of his life. I've never really seen eye to eye with him but my boyfriend is good friends with him. The one thing he hates is people last minute cancelling plans, which I 100% understand most of the time, but I also know that life happens and sometimes not everyone can make it. Joe has actually always been pretty good with coming. He has had to cancel a couple of times but was able to give notice and we rearranged for a better time.

Yesterday I woke up to see a mess in our group chat. From what I can gather, Joe had to cancel for a last minute work trip. They are flying him out to the US today for a week, and he had just found out. He was estatic, however this meant he obviously wouldn't be able to make our session, and Bob lost his shit at him. Partly due to the last minute cancellation but I feel like something else might have happened because he is not normally a super angry person. Joe even said he was happy for us to play without him but Bob was not having that. He doesn't like people missing out on his story because he works hard on it.

Anyway, I tried to defuse a little in a different group chat with everyone and a couple of others in, just saying how happy I was for Joe because I knew he wanted to go for a while and stuff, but in the original Dnd chat everyone else was kind of aggresive and taunting saying things like ""Ah, we're going to miss you Joe."", ""We had a good campain, your character was fun to play with"" and stuff like that as if its already established that he would no longer be welcome at these sessions. I tried again to calm people down saying it was just one session and it was a pretty good reason but people were like ""Nah, if Bob wants him gone, hes gone.""

My own boyfriend who was right next to me admitted it was a bit harsh but said there was nothing he could do, but I wasn't taking that. I argued with Bob for a bit longer but he wasn't having none of it. He in the end said something along the lines of ""If you want to go play with Joe, then go. No one is making you turn up to these sessions. You're just the eye candy anyway""

That last statement made me mad. The boys have always been super respectful to me playing with them. I really don't think siding with Joe was the wrong thing to do.

Fast forward to this morning, where I woke up feeling a little worse than usual (I’d been dealing with a cold for about 2 days and was hoping it would vanish by today) so I got up a little early and made myself some tea, took two teaspoons of cough syrup and even bundled up before heading outside to take the dog to pee.

Me and my Erik are both 16, and we write rap battles between our teachers in our spare time for fun. Our teachers love them as they're typically school appropriate, and we try our best not to make jabs between teachers too personal (not cracking jokes about a teacher's personal life, keeping it about what they show at school, the subjects they teach)

Recently, Erik texted me two verses he wanted me to choose between, with verse 1 having the top line in it, verse 2 having the second:

1. You can't think straight, even though I'm the queer
2. You look like a horse, and I can't stand nickers

I immediately told him I didn't approve of either, my reasoning being that I didn't feel comfortable using queer, since it means strange, and the second one is a joke about the N word.  I tell him why I'm against both and he responds ""Then why is it lgbtq, if they use it it's not offensive"" and ""It doesn't actually say the N word, it just sounds like it, it's fine.""

I tell him, again, that I'm not a fan of either line, that we can't use them if teachers are gonna read the raps. I also offer to help him come up with a new line if he can't think of anything, and that I like both the verses otherwise. A few minutes later, he tells me to decide between the two lines, he won't rewrite them because they're fine.

Later, when I told a third friend what happened he said I was a bit of a dick and that Erik's first verse was fine originally. I thought it was fine because I told Erik I changed the line and, being an online document, we could always change it to something better, but thinking about it, maybe I'm letting my opinion cloud what others deem a good line?

brliub,1558508419,AITA for intentionally pissing off my crazy neighbour so that she goes mental so I can get her kicked out?,"So my partner and I moved into this apartment about a year ago. That was a thursday. On the Saturday, we had my daughter, who I only have on the weekends. She is/was six years old.

My daughter and I were leaving the building to go to the park. As we were making our way out, the neighbour directly below us flew out of her apartment to talk to us. She's an old lady, and seemed nice.

""There's a park next door!""

""I love kids, I really do""

""The people in the apartment before you had kids and they were very noisy""

Anyway, the next day, at 11am, on a Sunday, we were vacuuming the floor. There's a knock at the door, it's crazy old lady. ""Can you please tell your children to stop running around up here, it's making my whole ceiling shake.""

Look over at six year old, she's sitting on the floor reading a book. ""There's no one jumping around up here, just vacuuming.""

""Please keep the noise to a minimum.""

Twenty minutes later there's a knock at the door. ""My WHOLE ceiling is shaking. I have a right to quiet enjoyment of my home, you have no right-""

""-I'm going to stop you right there,"" I say. ""My daughter left fifteen minutes ago with my partner to buy groceries. It's just me here, sitting, reading a book. I don't know what you're hearing, but it's not us.""

""No. I have a right to the peace and quiet!""

""Okay. Go make a noise complaint to Strata.""

Later we find random garbage in our letter box. We put a leaf with a mark in her letterbox. Next day, same leaf is in ours along with double the junk mail.

I decided that we would not try to be quiet. For the last year, we have walked heavily, asked my daughter to quickly go and get something so that she runs down the hallway.

And so, over the past year she has started screaming at the top of her lungs, whenever we so much as walk across the room. She screams obscenities out her windows. At one point, she started screaming incoherently in a wild rage and for 5 straight minutes continued to open and slam closed her sliding door. At least 100 times.

We intentionally try to set her off because it's funny.

Some neighbours were listening to music. It was 1pm on a Saturday. It was outside on their balcony, but not loud. Crazy lady started wandering around downstairs screaming up at them to turn the music off.

When this first happened, we emailed our landlord to let them know this lady was a bit unreasonable. Today, our landlord emails and says they've got a noise complaint coming. We laughed and emailed back that I bet it's the same lady I emailed about a year ago and that here's what's really been happening...

I am going to send them the video of her screaming and swearing and slamming everything and say that we don't feel safe and that her agression makes us uncomfortable.

chjtyq,1564034847,AITA for having asked for money back for a shared purchase from an ex,"This has been bothering me for a few years, so here we go;

A couple of years back I lived with my then-boyfriend in his apartment for 1 year to attend school in that city.
I was unable to get a job during the time, so my only income was school support of DKR 900, or ~$135 pr month. Despite this, I agreed to pay half of all rent, bills and utilities, which totaled at around DKR 3000, or $450 month, if he payed for groceries. This meant that I had to use all my income, and payed the rest with my hard earned savings, which were meant to take me to Japan after graduating. I feel like it’s relevant, that during this, my ex himself was making DKR15000-18000/$2250-$2700 pr month, and therefor did not need my help to make ends meet. To help out I was also during the majority of the cleaning and shopping, as well as all the cooking and laundry.
Despite knowing that I had a heavily negative income, he didn’t really get it, and talked me into buying lots of stuff, including (most expensively and the reason for this post) a shared PS4 when they came out.
While we were dating, he offered a few times to pay me my half for it, but in my naive pride, I refused.
I finished school and moved out to live at a boarding school about an hour away to study Japanese. During my first 6 months, he visited me once and never wanted to talk, and when seeing him at Christmas, I realized that I was hoping for him to break up with me. He did not, so I worked up my guts for about a month and after talking with some friends, I broke up with him in early February. He did not take it well, but was “nice” enough to return most of my things.
About a month or two later, I remember the PS4, and text him asking for the money. He refuses. I then offer, despite still having a negative income, to buy my half then; again he refuses. This turned into a text fight, in which he claimed that since he payed groceries for a year, I actually owe him money for that, as well as rent and bills, even though I payed half for the time living there.
Eventually I gave up and tried to let it go, since I was distraught about it, but it’s always kept bothering me, so;

So I get off my conference call, go to get the air compressor and it's empty since he didn't plug it back up, so it takes a min to fill up.

I'm pissed but start to put air in his tire, his hubcap, now cracked, was bent over the air plug so I ripped it off, and he freaks out, says it's always been cracked, to LEAVE IT FUCKING ALONE.

apl00c,1549919080,AITA for thinking my boyfriend is cheating?,"I recently began dating this guy that I’ve been best friends with for about two years now. We’ve always had a crush on each other, but no one has acted on it, until now. It’s been only a month since we became official, but it already seems like he’s keeping something from me. This is my first “serious” relationship, (I’m 16, btw) and I don’t really know how this stuff works yet. 

So on to the reason I believe he’s cheating/keeping something from me:
Last weekend, he went over to some girls house that I do not know. While he was there, he’d take upwards of 3-4 hours at a time to respond to my snapchats, when he usually answers almost Instantly. I’m not one of those psychos that freak out if their SO doesn’t answer right away, but it was out of the ordinary for him. But whatever, I let him enjoy his time with her, although I was jealous. But I felt guilty for being jealous because he’s allowed to spend time with other people.

We have geography class together, and I sit next to him, and I could see a name on his Snapchat that I recognized. It was this girl I added a while ago. But the problem with this is that the name was changed to be her name, followed by two hearts. When you add her on Snapchat, the hearts are not there. 

He also never lets me see his phone. I’ve noticed that whenever I touch his phone, he freaks. And when he uses it, he purposely points his screen away from me. 

And, he called my female best friend cute not too long ago. It made me uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything. He also doesn’t treat me much different from his other friends. He has called me “babe” and “beautiful” a handful of times, but he mostly calls me “fam” or “bro”. It really bothers me, but it’s just a habit for him, as he always calls everyone that.

The music I wouldn’t mind, but it’s really loud and distracting. I also wouldn’t mind the diffuser but whatever she uses is migraine-inducing.

It’s gotten to the point where I have to shut my door if I want to get anything done, which sucks because we have an open-door policy. 

I know that getting my boss involved again isn’t the asshole move because my boss has done so before. What makes it a potential YTA is that our secretary is already the loner on our team for reasons unrelated to the above problem.

We have given up and rarely make an effort to even speak to her if it’s not 100% necessary. We also complain about her in each other’s offices (whispering so she can’t hear us) because the quality of her work is mediocre at best and I often have to pick up her slack or redo her work completely.  I’m afraid that getting my boss involved again will only further ostracize her, thus making me the asshole.

I told him that sounded like a good idea.

Now, my friend changed his mind and told me that instead of going out to eat and just explore around and have fun, he's gonna throw his boyfriend a surprise birthday party and invite a bunch of people. I have social anxiety, so I start to feel really nervous and uncomfortable when I'm with a small group of people I don't know. It's not a huge party, it's a handful of people (like 10-12 I think) that all know each other and are close, so I wouldn't be able to just kinda fade into the background or anything. People would notice me not saying anything and just staying in my corner, which would make me feel even worse.

bp5awk,1557963211,AITA For leaving our daughter without money or anywhere to live?,"Hi all,

Our daughter just graduated from University with a degree in art. We (the parents) work as doctors and always tried to steer our daughter towards a high paying profession but her passion for art throughout school was very strong. When it came time for her to apply to University we told her that we won't pay for tuition if she studies something that doesn't have a good rate of return. She borrowed around $150k (NZD) of student loans to do her art degree and now she has a job that pays significantly less than the average wage doing some casual painting for small studios and her overall prospects don't look good - almost 100% of her paycheque goes on a rented apartment that she shares with two other people.

We haven't told her, but we're going to pay off her student loan debt this year so she can be debt free.

We (parents) want to sell our house and leave the country, we're looking at moving from New Zealand to Europe so we can enjoy skiing in the winter and french vineyards in the summer. We're in our 50's now so we feel like we've earned the right to start enjoying our lives rather than continuing to live in the city.

Our daughter recently asked if she could move back in with us in order to reduce her living expenses, we told her that we are planning on moving to Europe. She suggested that we let her stay in our house after we leave; we really need to sell the house as we need the money. She is incredibly angry at us for ""abandoning"" her. We feel that as a 22 year old adult, she should be able to take care of herself, we gave her access to the best private schools in the area, the best after school tutors and her grades were A's across all subjects. She chose to live the life of a suffering and poor artist despite us trying to get her interested in medicine, law, business etc. We tried not to push her too hard towards things that she had no interest in but we really did try to show her that art isn't going to let her live the kind of life that she became accustomed to when she lived with us (ski trips, nice houses, restaurants etc).

Are we the assholes?

Like it makes me really uncomfortable because not only can her friends see my photos when she comments on them but my friends can see her comments as well.

For those who are wondering the comments are ones that should properly be sent via PM like her mobile number or my personal favourite  when she commented on a photo that I took and tagged my entire drama (theatre) class in  and said “Oh hi lostmywaybackhome, Granny is flying over to see you now.”

As you can properly tell it’s a privacy issue, but it’s more than that.  It’s even worse when friends tag me in photos and she would respond so then my friends and family would see my aunt trying to be cool and hip by making “jokes”. One time she even posted her mobile number on a photo a friend of mine posted of me so everyone saw that.

But to make matters worse I would post something that I’m proud of (like passing all of my year 12 classes) and she would comment like “Oh you should check out my video about my horse”.

d3alil,1568306515,AITA for wanting my cat back?,"So a little over 6 months ago I(21F) moved out of my old apartment. My lease had come to an end and while I wasn’t planning on moving out at first I abruptly decided too after a few bad altercations with my roommate towards the end. 

When I decided to move out it was very last minute and didn’t give me time to save or find a new place. I had nowhere for me or my cat. So when my BFF(21F) and her roommate(23F) offered to take my cat I was beyond relieved. They said they would be happy to take her as long as I needed. 

When I moved my cat in I had brought her litter box, litter, food, toys, scratching post, etc. And I told my best friend that of course when she ran out of food and litter or anything I’d pay for more. 

So her roommate fell absolutely in love with my cat and actually offered to buy her. I told her that I wasn’t really looking to give her up but if I couldn’t find a place that wouldn't allow cats she could have her for free. 

After about 2 months of me not finding a place the roommate made it clear she would be happy to start buying her litter and food and I could just pay her back whenever. I told her it was fine and that I had the money but she absolutely insisted. But anytime I tried to pay her back she would not accept it.

After 4 months of me still not finding a place I found out the roommate had taken my cat to the vet without telling anyone. She saw my cat scooting on the carpet and assumed she had worms. If she had just asked me I would have told her she sometimes gets litter stuck to her butt and that’s her trying to get it off because I had already had her checked for the same reason. Even tho I saw no reason for the vet visit I still offered to pay her back because I appreciated her concern for my cat and she said it was alright. 

So flash forward to today and I have just moved into my apartment yesterday and I want my cat back. So I texted my BFF I’m coming over to get my cat and so she tells her roommate. Her roommate then proceeds to tell her that she thought the cat was hers now and she won’t be giving it back. My BFF told her she wasn’t her cat but she then proceeds to lock my cat in her room so we can’t get her. 

When I got there she still refused to give me my cat. She told me because it’s been so long and she’s been taking care of the cat and paying for everything she has claim to it. I told her I’d pay her back for everything and for it’s care and she told me no she wants the cat. I told her no and she actually started fucking crying. She told me she just loved my cat so much and didn’t want to give her back. I ended up just saying she can stay her for the night but I’ll be back tomorrow to get my cat.

I now feel bad because she had bonded with my cat so much but I love my cat, too and I want her back. I guess it has been a really long time but I was kinda being picky with apartments because they were happy to have her. AITA for wanting her back now?

Saw them at the social group and hung out with them again once or twice after that. Then I randomly got a late night (I'm thinking drunken) message about how we're not putting any effort into the friendship and we don't seem to be invested, we maybe knew this person for like a month at this point. I apologized saying it wasn't intentional and we'll do better. So we hung out with them a few more times, invited them to group outings, etc.

A few weeks later roommate and I were invited to a party by someone K didn't know, but a lot of people K met through this group went. K asked to hang out that day and I declined, saying I wasn't feeling it. Some of them posted about it on social media, which K saw and immediately messaged me asking if I was there, not wanting her to go off on me again I just lied and said I wasn't (which I'll admit was an asshole move). They apologized for making assumptions and we once again carried on.

Now here's the thing about K, they seem to have a superiority complex and can be pretty mean. At a party, they made fun of people they had just met and stuck by my side pretty much the entire time. They went to a prestigious college and come from a wealthy family and they seem to bring that into conversation A LOT. Conversations with them can sometimes feel like a one-upping competition, and they can hold you hostage in conversation for a LONG time. Honestly, they're just a tough person to be around.

They've also gotten a little clingy/obsessive with my and my roommate's friends. Picking up on similar interests (that they clearly didn't care about before), butting into conversations with them to talk about themselves, and inviting themselves to things/forcing friendship. Which I understand is part of getting to know people, but then they'll turn around and shit talk about them to me after. They're basically assuming that everyone wants to be friends with them, and they're being very aggressive in their pursuit while making other people really uncomfortable in the process (and some of my friends have said this). 

&#x200B;

It's at the point where I feel like I can't do anything without them with ""mutual friends"" because they'll call me out for not inviting them, and when I do hang out with them in group settings they make the other people there uncomfortable or make a joke that goes too far.

My mom is bedridden mostly, except when I put her into a wheelchair with a hoyerlift. Since my mom makes a little too much money to qualify for a lot of programs, we basically pay for everything out of pocket and it can get pricey. My neighbor, which is a lifelong friend of ours,  (my mom has known her since she was a child) gives us some supplies that she herself receives but doesn't use every month. 

&#x200B;

Lately, she's been acting weird. She barely says hi to me and has not given us supplies. I have not asked, I never do. Although I seen the supplies in her house. I can only surmise that it's because I don't tend to give her anything in return. She has trouble walking and gets around mostly in an electric scooter. She doesn't drive.  

&#x200B;

About a month ago I put a stop to her asking me for things. This is what would happen... I would go to the store, come back home and see her riding around the neighborhood, she would see me get out of the car with groceries and say, ""Whyyyyyyyyy didn't you tell me you were going to the store?"". Next time, I would come back from CVS and she would say, ""Whyyyyyyyyyyy didn't you tell me you were going to CVS?"" I would tell her I'm sorry, I didn't know. And it actually started to piss me off. She did this multiple times to the point where I started looking out of my door before I left and I would peek into the neighborhood before I drove in, to make sure she wasn't there. It got that bad. In my opinion, I shouldn't have to check if she needs something every single time I go somewhere. So I told her exactly that. And she said that I was right. And then she kind of stopped saying that.

My thought was that she seems to be under the impression that I have to give her something just because she gives me something. BTW, I have no problem with giving her something.

My mom decided that she’ll drop Mike home and Jen will crash at my house. Everyone else cleared out.

After comforting Jen a bit, we call it a night and go to bed. My SO KO’d, but I was still wired that I was unable to sleep. Very faintly, I hear knocking. I go downstairs and find Mike quietly talking to Jen. its 2am. Annoyed and angry, I asked what’s going on? He got an Uber over. Mike went from quiet to loud/aggressive. “I’m taking Jen home.” I told him that we weren’t gonna do this now and Jen wasn’t going home with him. Jen didn’t object. She told me earlier that she did not feel comfortable sleeping at the same house that night.

Edging Mike out of my home, I told him that he shouldn’t have come. He should’ve stayed home and grabbed Jen in the morning. He’s standing outside my door at this point. He goes “really? You’re going to keep her in and kick ME out? Guess I’ll just walk home.” Okay. I closed my door and locked it. I figured that since he Uber’d over that he’d Uber back. He’s a big boy.

bpq4w9,1558093075,AITA for not doing gift giving holidays,"On mobile so possible formatting and grammar issues, sorry. It's probably important to note that I'm on the autism spectrum and can have a lot of issues with social cues and understanding cultural expectation type things.

So, I'm in America but pretty much the only holidays I kind of celebrate are new years, Valentine's, Thanksgiving, and Halloween. Mostly because I'm a really big fan of big meals and I have a sweet tooth. 

For very many years now I haven't celebrated any of my family's birthdays, I haven't done Christmas, no father's or mother's day calls or gifts, etc, but my family always tries to force me into these things and refuses to respect that I don't want to do them. Its a bit that I'm a different religion from everyone else in my family but also just that all of those kinds of days feel really gross to me - just spending money because our culture says we suck if we don't, or calling a relative only because we're expected to, you know? Every year for almost a decade now they still ask what I want for my birthday or for Christmas and I always tell them nothing please it's been (x) years, please just respect this for once. And every year they're always annoyed that I don't want to be around during those kind of holidays for them to give me things and that I don't get them things. It's frustrating as hell.

They're starting to get more annoyed at me for not doing things like mother's and father's day too. I absolutely HATE doing phone calls and have really bad anxiety on top of just flat not wanting to, but they've tried to push me into calling family and wishing them happy mother's and father's days or calling them on their birthdays but I just really don't want to do it. It's so many awkward phone calls just so they don't think I hate them and so I don't think they're gonna be upset.

But like, I know that even if I don't celebrate these things they still do, and that to them it feels like I just don't want to celebrate them as a person I guess? AITA for not just participating in the gift giving and talking? How can I get them to lay off of me about not wanting to participate in things?

EDIT for info: With all of the holidays mentioned besides Valentine's I'll go out to their houses and spend time with them then and talk, help cook and clean, and hang out. For Valentine's it's normally just me and my partner and very small things like stuffed animals as comfort items and I'll buy candy for us both because I just fucking love candy. I'll buy candy for us both year round but there's just so much more candy on Valentine's. 

I'm a Buddhist convert and the religious objection is a whole thing about the suffering caused by desiring objects and putting value in things that can break or make you feel bad etc, and I try to not even place that much value in the things I have, no matter how expensive. I think I explain it better in a reply I made. Really hard to explain my feelings about it without sounding pretentious I think. Expressing feelings in general isn't my strong suit.

I also mentioned in a reply that with phone calls I'll ANSWER them but really don't make any phone calls and hardly even leave my room if it's not for work and school. I didn't even call any of my friends or family when I was hospitalized for mental health, and not because I didn't wanna talk to them. Everything about phone calls stresses me out - i don't understand what times of day it's okay to call, how many times to try, what to leave in a message if I don't get through, when or how to end a call, etc - but a lot of family has said that just texting this kind of stuff feels rude.

Since it seems like it's agreed that IATA here, at least specifically for mother's and father's day, I really have to wonder exactly how far out into my family I should be expected to do things? In-laws, family members that haven't really treated me or others well, family I barely know, just kind of everyone? I have a really big extended family, not counting in-laws, and feel like it would be unreasonable to get everyone presents or cards or call every single person or remember every birthday even for people I've only met once but who means I wouldn't be alive if they didn't have kids.

bfze3d,1555919419,AITA for ending my friendship with a childhood friend due to his strange girlfriend?,"This happened two years ago, but to this day, I feel guilty. Long story short, I grew up with Ted, my ex-best friend of about 12 years. 

Ted and I felt more like brothers than anything else. I trusted him with everything in my life, and he did the same with me. He ended up moving abroad and meeting his current girlfriend who I'll call Melissa. 

Melissa seemed great at first. She was really nice to me and Ted and other mutual friends. After months of dating, Melissa made me really uncomfortable. She added me on all of my social media accounts and started sending me private messages, asking if I was online to talk. I told Ted about these messages, and he said she was just trying to be nice.

Once when I was online, she started messaging me, telling me intimate details about arguments she had with Ted. She wanted my advice. I told Ted all about this, and he just blew it off. The messages got so weird, I ended up telling Ted that her messages were getting too intense. 

Guess what? He told her everything I said. After this, she started spamming my facebook with messages calling me a cuck, a fag, and other slurs just because I didn't want her messaging me. I showed everything to Ted, and he didn't defend me or stand up to her. She kept sending me abusive messages until he finally ""talked"" to her about it. 

Eventually, I told Ted I didn't want to be friends with him anymore if he was going to let his GF ruin our friendship. He told me I was overreacting and didn't understand why I was ending our friendship. After this, I never talked to him again.

Just a few days ago, a mutual friend of ours told me Ted still hates me because I ""abandoned"" him over something stupid. AITA for ending this friendship?

tl;dr ... best friend of years gets a gf who harrassed me on social media. When I told him I didn't want to be friends anymore, he said I was overreacting.

Update: The messages she sent me mostly bashed Ted and his shortcomings in their relationship. They also mentioned other private aspects of their lives that weren't any of my business knowing. I did tell her these messages made me uncomfortable and that I didn't really know how to respond to her comments. She kept sending me messages even after this, though.

Anyway, I said yes, but asked that they cover the cost of my accommodation for an extra night (as I’ll have to be up fairly early to do bridal prep shots and the wedding is a seven hour drive for me), which they said they would do. A few hours later I get a message from Jesse:

“Hey dude. This whole thing seems to be turning into a business arrangement and really you’re coming as a guest — we want you to have fun and we’re only asking for a few snaps and your food is already being covered. I don’t want you thinking we want loads of pics because we don’t.” I feel like the undertone was that they’re paying for food so they don’t expect to pay for the hotel/accommodation for the extra night.

I feel really hurt because a hotel room costs roughly $150 and clearly, they don’t even think my work is worth that much, which was a bit of a blow to my ego.

That being said, I feel like a $2,000 wedding photography package is a gift in itself and I shouldn’t have to fork out an extra night for a hotel room, but part of me is wondering if I should have just avoided saying anything at all.

4dy1f9,1460144392,AITA for not bagging my own groceries?,"So about six or 7 years ago I decided to take over cooking and shopping duties for my household of 5.  Long before I took over, and for a few years after, the grocery store had your [traditional style checkout stands]( http://i.imgur.com/zpUTnLW.jpg) where the cashier would take your items from the first conveyor (which you typically loaded yourself), scan them, then place them on a second conveyer that would go to a bagger at the end of the stand who would then load your cart.  Practically every lane with the exception of the express lanes was set up like this.  

A couple of years back the grocery store took out the old stands and replaced them with these updated ones that removed the traditional bagger’s area and replaced them with the carousel-style bagging system you typically see at [self-checkouts]( http://i.imgur.com/cx29l8J.jpg).  I suppose you could describe it as a [hybrid of the two stands]( http://i.imgur.com/wgiNaWm.jpg), and though no one comes right out to say it, the intent seems clear to me; They want you to bag your own groceries.  

There are maybe 1-2 baggers/runners on shift at the time and day I go, when there used to be about one to every lane.  When they were first installed, it was a nightmare.  Lines were stacked up further back than I had ever seen, customers were upset with the new system and many were not afraid to complain to any employee that would listen.  In the time since they were first installed it has gotten a little bit better, though not as fast as it was before, and I am still not having it. 

 I don’t mind loading my own cart, but I am not going to stand there and bag the groceries when there are plenty of other grocery stores in the area (even ones owned and operated by the same company) that don’t have these new stands.   Every time I shop I play a waiting game with the cashier; who is going to flinch first and start bagging the groceries?  Not I.  I look over to the next lane and see some little old lady bagging her own groceries, and I know others are looking at me and thinking “Look at this asshole, if she can do it, why can’t you?”  My feelings are not that this little old lady should be bagging her own stuff and I shouldn’t, but that neither one of us should, nor should the judging eyes.  And until the store tells me their intent is for me to bag my own stuff, I’ll keep playing this little game to see who gives in first.

My boyfriend and I recently moved in together. We’ve been dating for just over a year and a half. Before we lived together our relationship was great imo, he works long hours some times and is off for days at a time. So sometimes I would see him everyday and other times I would see him like once a week. I noticed that when he worked long hours and I saw him only once a week he was kind of obnoxious and irritating. Like he was stressed and tired and expressed that in a unique way. Aka he was a dick. But when he had time to relax he was awesome.

Anyway we moved in together and I started getting irritated at him because of the way he talked to me and and about others. He’d come home from work late at night and would drink almost a whole 12 pack of beer in less than an hour and be kind of rude. He would tell me dinner sucked or that I needed to hurry up and wash clothes because he was sick of seeing it piled up. I have a job too and it stresses me out when he comes home and is like that with me. It’s gotten to the point where I lie about being sleepy just so he won’t talk to me. Or on his days off I’ll make up an excuse to just not be around him.

b3oeli,1553160077,AITA for not wanting to be out of pocket to return keys?,"I stayed in my boyfriend's house last night. We both left for work at the same time this morning, and half way down the road I realised I left my phone under the pillow. He had no time to go back as he needed to catch a specific train so I took his keys and got it myself. The problem then was that we don't work near each other and I would have no chance during the day to return them.

&#x200B;

I called him when I got into the house and offered to hide the keys in a pile of stuff he has in the porch ready to go to a charity shop and he said no (understandable). When I was on the bus I called him again to discuss what to do, and he said I should put them in a taxi to his job. I work in the City Centre and he works out in a suburb and the total cost would be around €25-€30 so I said no. I offered three alternatives:

1. I meet him during his commute home, he wouldn't even need to step off the train.
2. I could take the bus out to where he works and give them to him if he's staying in the area late.
3. I could go to his house when he needs to get in, then go home to my own place from there.

&#x200B;

Each of these options would take 2+ hours out of my evening.

&#x200B;

He refused all of these saying they were too much hassle. At this point we started to argue and fair enough, it was my mistake that I needed to go back and I did technically cause this annoyance, but I don't think it's that big of a deal or anything to fight about, especially considering  I'm offering to do all that running around. He won't be home until 6:45 at the absolute earliest yet he's still demanding I get the keys to him by 5:30. This would mean me leaving work early to bring them, or footing that taxi bill. I ended up scoffing about how big of a deal he was making this and calling him unreasonable before hanging up.

&#x200B;

I was thinking about it then, and rang him back offering to compromise and pay half of the taxi fare, he could pay whatever was left when the keys arrived. He said no and hung up. I'm in work now way more upset than I should be, and unable to concentrate on my work because I'm worrying about this simple problem being a huge argument.

&#x200B;

EDIT TO UPDATE: I put his keys in a taxi in the end. It cost €40. I asked him to tell me when it arrived and he allowed me to believe it hadn't when it had, and I got worried and stressed about the driver potentially scamming me and losing the keys and money. I only found out when I offered to go to the police and his reaction was weird and dismissive. I said ""you have the keys don't you?"" and he hung up. Then I got a text saying they keys arrived 10 minutes before that phone call. I'm fucking fuming at how unneccesary the whole fight was, and how unwilling he was so cut me any slack.

cl7n2l,1564769115,AITA Reclining My Seat On A Bus,"Was having a debate with a few people and while I already have an idea, I really wanted to get a general sense of opinions and etiquette. 

So I was on a Flix the other day, not too full, and I had the window seat, with the aisle seat empty. Another passenger was directly behind me, his aisle seat also empty. As it was a night bus, I'm tryna catch some Z's, so I pop the seat back and lean on the window. I feel some knees in the back of the seat but think nothing of it. Maybe the dude was caught off-guard and had his legs crossed, needing to shift them accordingly. So I close my eyes and get ready to slumber, when I get a tap on my shoulder. 

""Can you please sit here, so that you can recline your seat?"" he asks, indicating the aisle seat beside where I am sitting. 

#

""Ok,"" I think, ""He asked politely, and I can see how it would be uncomfortable."" But at the same time, the seat beside him is available, his seat is ALSO reclined to its fullest capacity and there is no one behind him in the aisle. So I respond,

#

""If it's uncomfortable for you, you can also move to the unoccupied seat beside you, where you wint be bothered."" As I see it, I am well within my rights to recline, as is he, to request my switch. But if it bothers *him*, why should *I* be the one to move?

#

He answers, ""But then I won't be able to lean on the window!""  Seems like we will both have that problem, and I told him as much. But alas, I did end up moving, but only a while later and only because  I was in a seat directly by the back stairs, where there was a little table and lots of space in front where I could put my feet up. In this position, it was more comfortable to be seated in the aisle. No harm, no foul, I guess.

#

But who was the asshole in this situation? Does everyone not have a right to recline their seat that minimal 4 inches? 

I know in some situations, it's best not to recline. For example, a few weeks ago I was sat in front of a morbidly obese man. I could see it was a struggle for him to be in the seat already, and I felt that, if I reclined, this dude would be absolutely stuck. So I sucked it up for the whole 10 hour night bus without reclining (luckily a seat opened up directly in front of mine and I switched  and slept okay for about 4 hours). 

Anyways, I appreciate the responses and feedback. Just want to get a general idea and sense of how folks see this particular etiquette.

He kept whining about how he wished he could go up further, (which I understood), and then he just started pouting and telling me that I was just being there with him because I had to. I tried to tell him that I didn't want him to be alone, but he was just wallowing in self-pity, and eventualy ended up yelling insults at me about random stuff.

dd5rho,1570186596,AITA for being upset with my brother for telling my parents about my drug use?,"*Names have been replaced for anonymity*

Two years ago, my younger cousin James (24) started to dabble with recreational drugs. James lives at home with his parents who are staunchly against drugs. He has always been particularly close with my brother, David (25). David is also not fond of drugs, however his opinion is not as black and white.

Along with most of my friends, I’ve been a recreational drug user for the last seven years (I’m 26). In no way do drugs permeate throughout any of our lives outside of weekends/festivals and we regularly go months without using.

David has always been worried about James’ drug use and has expressed this multiple times (interestingly, he also says my drug use does not bother). It’s not entirely unwarranted as I do agree that James can get a little reckless (I’ve told him to simmer down before too). He’s always receptive and reels it in. It has never gotten to the point where I have been concerned.

Recently my aunty and uncle found out about James’ drug use. They made him promise to never touch drugs again. As we often hang out together, they made the assumption that me and my friends also use. They told my parents about their suspicions who then approached David to confirm them (he did).

My parents approached me about it two weeks ago which was not pleasant. They’re anti-drug (my Dad’s brother (different uncle) was a heroin addict). It is a part of my life I never wanted to share with them as I don’t believe they will ever be able to discuss or understand drugs objectively.

As a result of this, I told James we can’t hang out anymore. Even if he stops using, his parents will assume that he still does because we’re hanging out. They’ve explicitly expressed their concern over our fortnightly BBQs (no drugs) and midday study sessions (again, no drugs). The only time they aren’t concerned is when David is also attending.

To summarise:

* I can't  hang out with James, who along with being my cousin is one of my closest friends
* James can’t spend time with a lot of his friends due to not wanting to upset his parents further
* I  dread the idea of spending time with my parents due to the awkwardness of this whole situation (same for my aunty and uncle)
* My parents think all of my friends are drug addicts (none of them are more than recreational users)

It’s also negatively impacted my relationship with my brother David as I largely blame him for the entire situation. David thinks that I should apologise to him for directing my anger towards him. I told David that he intentionally dragged me into this to get through to James. He confirmed that along with not wanting to lie to our parents, this was true. He justifies the entire situation as he believes he only did what he had to do to get through to James and stop him from spiralling into drug addiction. I told David that I don’t disagree he is well intentioned, however I strongly believe that his biased opinion of drugs has exaggerated the entire thing.",False,not the asshole,20,99,0

Turns out I don't react to constant fighting over abstract immeasurable concepts very well and I need more time to myself to recovery and spend less time with her as a result, which only increased the fighting as now she feels ""lonely"" despite me still talking to her for hours a day and giving her support in general.

Recently I've just been getting annoyed every time there's some kind of issue between us. Nothing happens to warrant fighting or arguing but it still happens. I tell her I'd like to invest some money a month for our children when we have them and we're financially stable and she starts a fight with me over her assumptions that I'll make us live ""poorly"" to make up for it.

It happened as a result of us being in the same friend group and was never very serious.

Towards the end of our relationship, F wanted me to wear one of his sweatshirts to support him since he had a soccer game that day. No problem. He told me I could give it back whenever. We ended up breaking up shortly after, and the sweatshirt was the last thing on either of our minds. For 3 months after the breakup, he stalked me. He would show up to restaurants I was at and outside of my house at night and he would look through my windows and text me about it. So I figured the safest thing to do was no contact and blocked him on every platform. He would keep finding new ones to contact me on, and I would keep blocking him. He even had his little sister try to add me on SnapChat and would keep changing his profile pictures to old pictures of us to try to get me to talk to him. I kept with no contact, and things died down. 2 years later, F has made a new Instagram and messaged me to ask for his sweatshirt back. I don’t want to give it to him. I don’t want it.

c299x2,1560899155,AITA (M 43) for asking my wife (F39) to spend more time with her family,"Hi assholes.

So I spend half my time thinking I am well righteous, the other half thinking IATA.

We have two boys aged 4 and 6. I get them out of bed in the morning, ready them for school, dress, teeth, do homework, make beds, make our bed, sort breakfast and take them to school. She makes their lunches.

Wife is up at 5am every morning to go running. Returns at 7am, spends an hour showering and getting ready for work. We both work from home, I am the main breadwinner.

Wife fetches kids from school at 5pm and usually makes dinner. Goes to yoga on Wed eve and gym Friday eve, so I cook then. If she is 'out' with her gal pals, usually once but sometimes twice a week, I make dinner. After dinner, I do bathtime and homework, and then I spend an hour or so with my boys playing Xbox or doing puzzles. At 7:45 I chase the lads to wee and get into bed, then I read a storybook and tell them some tales of when I was young. While all this is happening, the Mrs does dishes (I help stack the dishwasher and I always empty it the next morning) or is on her phone.

Wife does not involve me or the boys in her sports, actively avoids it. She doesn't like coming with on our Saturday and Sunday walks with the dog + boys, which is hard because 4yo is learning to ride his bike with me pushing, and me also hanging on to an unruly beagle.

So here's my gripe - I hassle her regularly telling her she needs to be more involved in parenting and she needs to involve  our boys in her sports (she often hints that I should take them to soccer or hockey...but I am a cyclist and a runner and a hiker, and I take my boys cycling, running and hiking). We occasionally have fights over this and she gets very defensive and never admits any fault, but after a fight things will improve for a while as she makes more effort (like taking the laundry off my hands, which does make my life easier).

I have also said to her being up at 5am every morning and out most evenings isn't on; she says her fitness makes her happy and that it isn't her problem if I choose not to go out (I rarely do 'man time' with my mates). I also tell her that she is obsessed with her appearance (she is a very attractive woman) and should tone it down, spending an hour every morning on makeup etc is OTT.

I say she should consider that 'her happiness' isn't the top priority here - I have gladly sacrificed my own in the interests of raising children better, and I have gotten used to doing new things for fun. That aggravates her a lot.

So, am I the asshole? Bear in mind, the way she will tell this story will probably be radically different, so try put yourself in her shoes. And she is a lovely person, too, we've been married for nearly a decade and together for 15 years.",False,no assholes here,12,24,0

We lost connection for a few years (I was in a different province for a while) and when we reconnected he had a new boyfriend.

Well they've been together a couple years now and I've been slowly losing patience since day one. He apologizes for everything. Every sentence. If my forgiveness isn't convincing enough, he gets somewhat panicked and I'll have to comfort him for 10+ minutes until his next apology.  He'll also move on to try rubbing my shoulders, or braiding my hair, or massaging my hands. I guess he has a need to 'fix' and since he feels his apology isn't enough he goes into care-overdrive. I'm not a fan of any of this. And he has a really hard time backing off when I say no. I had to have a long talk with him and my friend because if I'm being touched after I've asked to stop, I start to panic and and get really angry (on the inside. He doesn't see this) so I've started to just ignore the apologies in case my forgiveness isn't strong enough for him.

I know this is an anxiety response. I have anxiety too. (Along with depression, BPD, and PTSD. Nice little cocktail). But the dude refuses to take medication or see a therapist or do anything that would help him out here. And I can't cut him out without losing my friend, too.

It's going to be small, only 12 guests, so we're having dinner at a 5 star restaurant rather than having the event catered. I met with the restaurant manager a couple of months ago and explained that I was lactose intolerant. She assured me they could accommodate. A few days ago she emailed me the proposed menu for the 5 course meal everyone would be eating. Every item except one looks like it contains dairy.

&#x200B;

I asked if they'd be using dairy substitutes, and she told me no, they had a ""separate menu"" planned for me. I don't want to be an asshole or a bridezilla, but I am honestly baffled and annoyed. If they have to plan a separate menu anyway, why not just make the entire thing without dairy? Is it really easier to do two separate 5 course meals?

&#x200B;

For some context, I am not dairy free by choice, and I was not born this way. I developed the intolerance about 4 years ago. I am a foodie and I LOVE cheese, creamy sauces, ice cream, all things dairy.  The ""actual"" menu the restaurant manager sent me looks amazingly delicious, and I don't want to be staring enviously at what everyone else is eating. If it weren't my own wedding, I'd suck it up and be grateful someone accommodated my issue. However, this is going to be an expensive dinner and it's my own freakin' wedding! My fiancé is very supportive and has given up dairy with me except for the occasional pizza. Would I be a selfish bridezilla if I asked the restaurant to serve everyone this ""separate menu,"" whatever it is?

&#x200B;

Would I be an asshole for not letting my guests enjoy the dinner the restaurant has planned for them? Thank you for any feedback! I have not yet decided whether to make an issue out of this or just let it go.

EDIT: I agree that I WBTA if I were restricting everyone from ordering what they wanted off the restaurant's normal menu. This is going to be a pre-set 5 course dinner. Salad, App., Entree, 2 desserts. Everyone has the same thing (but could opt out of one or two if they didn't like it). It's not going to be a normal catered wedding where you have 3 or 4 options.

EDIT: Since people are asking, I don't know what the ""separate"" menu is. The restaurant manager hasn't emailed it (yet?). I think that's mainly why I'm upset. If this restaurant is as good as I've been told, the non-dairy menu should be great too, but it seems like they've focused all their energy on the ""main"" menu, so I don't know.",1563466217.0,not the asshole,38,85,0

&#x200B;

I'd been in a kinda long-term online relationship with this guy, to the point where we were pretty comfortable with each other, and had visited several times.  He ended up having a nervous breakdown over school stuff, and in general hating the state he lived in, so I offered to let him move in with me.  I wasn't really worried about any of this, as I'd been self-sufficient for a good year or so.  He took me up on the offer and moved in, and we renewed the lease on my place with both of us signing on it.  Things were good for a while, until a few months later when he broke up with me.  He wants to still remain friends, but a few things are getting in the way of that for me.  For one, there's only one bedroom in my apartment, so we still sleep in the same bed, and the somewhat small area we live in means I'm around him quite a lot.  It's very hard for me to get over him when I'm around him so much.  Second, he keeps going back and forth on being cuddly and affectionate, which is really giving me mixed signals.

&#x200B;

Now, I recently got a car (I'd been using the city's public transit entirely before, but decided it was about time to bite the bullet), which is opening up my options for where I can live, and I'm starting to look at more areas around town for the next time my lease will be up, in a few months' time.  I've come to the pretty firm realization that, even though he has been helping with rent which is a nice boost to my budget, I would kind of rather live alone if I'm not going to be living with someone I'm romantically involved with.  The thing that's making this complicated for me is that he has no local friends, and relies on me entirely for his social health.  A big part of me would honestly feel bad leaving him to fend for himself since I was the one that suggested he move here in the first place.

So basically I was at a bar with some friends and my girlfriend. The bar had a dance floor, but it was pretty dead and there was nobody really on it. Sitting near the dance floor at the bar was a small group of girls, one of whom was very clearly upset, had been crying, etc. It felt a little weird but they weren’t in the dance floor and so my friends and I decided to be idiots and start dancing. While we were dancing I still had a full drink so I put it down at bar, relatively near the girls but not in front of them. Next thing I knew the girl threw the entire drink all over my back. 

I was pretty pissed in the moment because I was so shocked, but my immediate reaction was to say “what the fuck.” As I turned around the girl who threw my drink on me was already being ushered out of the bar by a couple of friends and she was sobbing. Two other girls apologized profusely to me and told me she was going threw a divorce and had been talking all night about how guys are evil and she’s done with men. They apologized and I calmed down, but I also added that it definitely sucks she’s going through a divorce but that doesn’t really excuse her behavior. I asked them to buy me a new drink and they had some excuses but basically the answer was no. I sort of stood my ground and said that it’s the right thing to do to buy me a new drink since it was sort of an expensive drink and the girl who wasted mine had already left. The girls once again said no and one of them actually made a comment saying it was rude that I was not being understanding. 

The girls left without paying for my drink and my girlfriend was on my side (she kept calling them bitches) but a couple of my girlfriends friends were saying that I need to calm down and that I’m not being understanding. I was definitely mad, but I never raised my voice. They said I was being rude to her and her friends and that I should have a heart for not considering her feelings.

we have a 4+ month old infant. he's amazing in every way. now that he's this age we've discussed sleep training him so that he's able to sleep through the night. must of my friends with kids have done it and for some it's been easy and straightforward and for others it's been difficult. but pretty much everyone I know has at least successfully sleep trained their kid to some degree. 

we both discussed and agreed on an approach and I made sure to stress how there are times we're going to have to let him cry and self sooth so he learns to fall asleep on his own. I also stressed that we have to be united and consistent in our approach or the sleep training will fail. she agreed with all of the above before we started. 

the first night was hard and it took roughly an hour of crying in between us soothing him at regular intervals before he finally went down for the night but he was able to sleep for 10 hrs straight. amazing, thought we were on a good trajectory. second night was better as he went down after about 30 min of crying. 

third night he missed an afternoon nap and was unbelievably fussy at bedtime and it took 3 hrs of intermittent crying before he finally went down but not before the wife broke some of our pre-arranged guidelines like feeding him again, and rocking him to sleep. he woke up a couple of times that night and my wife decided to feed and rock him despite my objections

the next morning she said she couldn't bear his crying and wants to stop sleep training altogether. I said I strongly disagreed and said it's hard for me to listen to him crying too but that it's important for him and for us that he learns to fall asleep on his own. in the meantime I said if she really doesn't want to sleep train, then she's the one that will have to get up with him when he cries in the middle of the night. she called me an asshole but said fine, that's what's she'll do.

I was to move out of the house to another town for school two weeks later. My father works in another town during the week so he isn't home until the weekend. When my mom and I were alone that week, I told her I wasn't coming home that weekend. I literally feared for my life at this point. I went to my boyfriend's house for the weekend. (I was now to move out in a week).

By Monday, I decided to stay another day, just to be sure. I got a call from my mom saying that my dad was MAD and that I needed to come home. She came to get me and in the car ride back home told me everything he told her during my little escape. He called her stupid, a whore and all types of other names for allowing this. He talked about her dad, who died when she was four, and said he was lucky to have never met her because she's so stupid.

When we got home, my father scremed at me and insulted my mother in front of me. He wouldn't stop insulting my relationship with my boyfriend. We'd been togheter for only a month. I learned that his entire tantrum was basically because he didn't approve my relationship. (I'm still a minor and he's 6 years older than me. The age of consent is 16 where I live and I was at least that, so nothing illegal). After I argued with him for quite a while, everything settled down and he started crying that he lost his last weekend with his babygirl. I thought it was the end of it.

Boy was I wrong! That night, while I was in my room with my sister, we heard my parents screaming at each other in the kitchen. My father ended up kicking my mom out of the house, followed by my sister who always hated him. I called my boyfriend to get me, wrote my phone number on a board downstairs in case my father would want to talk. 

The only time I went back that week was on Saturday, so that my mom could finish moving me and my stuff to my apartment.

The next weekend, when I went back, my mom was back with my father and everyone acted like nothing happened.
I no longer stay in their house and everytime I'm in my hometown, I stay with my boyfriend. When I'm to their house, I act like everything is fine because I don't want to cause a scene. I don't want to have anything to do with him and he is no longer the boss of me.

cg21wm,1563732578,AITA for holding up the bus?,"Throwaway here 

So this happened about three months ago, but I only just now found out about this sub. I’m still not sure about this situation, as my friends seem to disagree on it. 

So up until this incident, I (15f) was not having a good day. We were on a field trip to a museum, and I was stuck in a group with two people that I can’t stand. The day was long and boring, and I hadn’t had breakfast (this is important). At the end of the trip, the two people I didn’t like didn’t show up at the group’s assigned meeting place. 

The teachers let everyone go to the buses but my group. They made us wait for these two for twenty minutes until they were finally found and our group had to walk to the bus, in front of everyone that “we” had held up. 

We got on, and as I went to my seat, where I had left my lunch, I noticed that my lunch was gone. I asked everyone around me, then went up to the front of the bus, where all the teachers were, and asked if any of them had seen it. The bus driver said “okay, sit down.” Here’s how it went after that:

Me: can I check the trash can?
Bus driver: just sit down. 
Me: please, it will only take a second. 
Bus driver: Can’t you just check when we get back? Sit down. 
Me: No! I’m not sitting down until I find my lunch 

Me looking for my lunch and talking to the bus driver took about 5 minutes, holding up the bus even longer. 

She didn’t say anything and just started the bus, and I had to sit down.

cffppn,1563583782,AITA if I confront my coworker who publicly embarrassed me in front of my superiors? Do I need to let it go.,"Hello guys. I've had a tough week so I kind of need to know if I'm overreacting about this. 

I recently started a job as a department head in a nursing home. There are only four of us as department heads on my unit. However, my direct supervisor was out on personal leave when I was hired, another was on vacation, and the other was transferred to my unit just a few days before me. So I was basically left to fend for myself and several others from other units took me under their wing until my supervisor came back. 

The head of the kitchen has a reputation for being abrupt and offensive, everyone says ""oh that's just [Blake] and how he is. Don't take it personally."" The first week there in all of our morning meetings I had a question (what is my phone number, can I get a key to my office, I had a family ask me for my business card so how do I get those) you know, all things I NEEDED to know.

The kitchen head pulled me aside after a week and said, ""you need to chill out. Everyone can tell you're frustrated and don't want to be here."" I was floored because I absolutely wanted to be there and while I had a lot of questions, I was not at all frustrated. I thanked him for sharing and spoke to my friendly HR rep- I told her I was so sorry if I had given that impression. She said I hadn't and said ""That's just Blake."" 

Today in the parking lot I totally cut Blake off. Totally my fault. In morning meeting, all of the department heads and the ED were there. He hollered across the room ""YOU ALMOST KILLED ME THIS MORNING, YOU FLEW THRU THAT STOP SIGN; I HAD HR IN THE CAR"" and everyone kind of laughed. I just laughed as well said I would try not to kill anyone. But I was so embarrassed! Humiliating. 

He could have pulled me aside if he was concerned about my driving. Not roast me in front of everyone only a month after I've started. 

AITA if I professionally ask him what the hell his problem is? I'm the new girl, youngest in the room by at least 10 years.

d46zey,1568476615,AITA for telling my roommates to be quiet?,"I’ve had a stressful sleep deprived week and I wanted to get to sleep early (around 11 to 12) Friday night and catch up on sleep. Two of my roommates last night were drinking and laughing in the kitchen area and my room, which is close to the kitchen, and the apartment in general has really thin walls and I could hear everything. Not just the inaudible sound of people talking but like I could hear their conversations and what they said clearly. Earbuds only help muffle a little bit. I tried to ignore it but around midnight I was fed up and texted them in our group chat if they could be quieter. 

Then they were quiet and I drifted off until I woke up again to the sound of laughter at 2:30 am. This time I was really annoyed so I sent some snippy texts that were “can u guys at least whisper, it’s 2am”

I felt really bad at being snippy and this morning made me feel worse when one roommate confronted me and asked “how I was doing.” I was honest and said Im still stressed, I didn’t sleep well last night. 

Then my roommate said “Yeah i understand well my room is really close to the kitchen too (hers is next to mine) but i don’t really say anything” which made me feel bad like I should’ve tried harder to suck it up or something. Like I guess it’s true that I’m sure everyone has had to deal with stuff like this at some point but they don’t really complain, it’s mostly just me. Then she said “I was really stressed last week too, last night was like my way of stress relief.” Which also made me feel like an asshole for getting in the way of that and making her feel guilty, but I also feel like sleep is a necessity and there are other ways to relieve stress besides drinking. 

IDK. She apologized but it was just like “sorry, but I can’t promise not to do it again because it’ll probably happen again but we can try.” which to me felt like a really half assed apology and really only said so after I said I slept really poorly. I mean I probably apologized more for being annoying bc I felt guilty. 

I really have no idea if I’m TA here for complaining.

c50ptm,1561429015,AITA for re-homing my cat?,"When I was 21, I broke up with my boyfriend and moved into my first apartment on my own. A friend of mine had four cats and a dog and was desperately attempting to re-home two of her five year old cats due to her impending relocation. I offered to take them because it was lonely in my place by myself, I wanted a cat, plus I already knew hers. She had two rules: 1. Never declaw and 2. If I have to re-home, they come back to her. I adopted them and kept one for 9 years (he wound up passing away from kidney failure after a lifetime struggle with struvite crystals) and the other for 11 years. I moved apartments 8+ times with the cats, including taking them with me from West to East coast. When I was relocating back to the West coast, I would be crashing on a friend's couch who had two indoor/outdoor cats and mine had been indoor only for 16 years at that point (she was also very tiny when born and weighed about 7 lbs, failing eyesight  and possible hearing loss - it would've been bad to start letting her go outside at that point but I wouldn't have had control). I chose to rehome her back with my friend, driving to Kansas to drop her off before continuing to CA alone. She passed away less than two years later. 

&#x200B;

It's been five years since I had a pet, three of them I've been set up comfortably in my own apartment.

He just proceeded to tell me about the position, and how they are hiring for all positions (FT/PT/PRN) at the moment.

“On Thursday night, I told him that I would let him know by Sunday and I let him know this morning via text and he hasn’t responded.

Really, you have better resume than mine. You have the EXPERIENCE!  My point is you know you are better off than me as far as job marketing goes and you came in in the middle of my job offer and made him change his decision. That’s my theory.

ch1ppd,1563932633,AITA because my mother left her estate to charity and not her child/grandchild?,"My mother for the last two years of her life, was very sick. She could afford nurses for her palliative care but was adamant nothing be done. Because I don't want my mother's last couple of years be in misery, I decided to leave my career as a HS teacher to care for her. I'd spend all my days there with her, nights at home. Sometimes my husband and daughter would come for the day, too, but I'd say about 85% of my time awake since early 2017 to two months ago was with my mother at her home. When she passed, I was the one who found her.

She left almost all of her entire estate, including her house, to a charity that focuses on her specific illness. She named a third party as executor to handle selling her house so I'm not involved. I basically spoke to the lawyer in one meeting and was told they'll handle it from there. Her funeral was paid out of her estate. It wasn't a life changing amount of money, only about $40,000 plus the bungalow she lived in.

It upsets me because she left nothing to me. Nothing to her granddaughter. Ultimately it was her choice and it should be honored, but this isn't how estates are usually passed down. Sure, I got just enough to not contest the will according to the lawyer, but the brunt of it went to a charity I wasn't even super familiar with. Keep in mind I took care of her, every day, for two years.

It's not like we're destitute ourselves. I could only do it because my husband could carry the family. It doubly stings because there's waitlists for local HS teachers. Leaving my career is one thing, rejoining it is monumentally tougher, even with experience.

I just feel like an asshole that it's affecting me so much. My mother loved me, my daughter, my husband. Why would she give pretty much nothing when she passed?

I am then given a confusing story of an original round trip being purchased through 1 airline, only for her to realize she had points through another airline with an earlier time she preferred - so she then purchases the arrival flight I received - and says she is going to contact the original airline to see if she can drop the arriving flight and keep the departing flight. 

Over this past weekend I ask again where the return flight is and the story keeps changing or there’s some excuse. “Oh I left my charger at home for my laptop I can’t email you the code” or “I bought it through my work email and I can’t access that from home”. Today I asked her to please email the information so my bf and I can make arrangements for travel as well as make sure we are home in time, as we both work the next day. She finally texts me today saying that the new return flight won’t be purchased until *the night before we leave*. 

At this point my bf and I are getting extremely nervous about this trip. I am having horrible anxiety about being there in general, on top of the flight issues. My parents can be very shady. One of many examples being, when I was still living with my parents, I flew back to the state I live in now to visit my bf. While I was away, my parents sold my car that I paid for entirely myself and kept the money. (It was a long line of made up/constantly changing stories and lies until eventually I never saw a dime from it. Very similar to what’s happening now). 

My bf and I have a theory there was no original round trip purchased. My bf is also saying that if the return flight isn’t purchased before we leave, that we should not get on the flight.

We were getting to know one another, finding out what our common interest were.  We both like the mountains, watching horror movies and we both have our own struggles with depression.  She said she wanted to start out as friends and I thought ""cool, someone to hang out with and get to know.""

&#x200B;

We traded cell phone # and  took our conversation off of OKC and into texting.  I show her pictures of my two dogs and one cat, we talked a little bit more.  She wanted a full body picture of me, so I sent her a fully clothed full body picture of myself.  I'm still operating off the fact that we're just friends.

 This is where things get muddy for me.  She asked if I wanted a full body naked picture of her and I told her that was up to her, whatever she was comfortable with.  So she sent me a naked picture of herself from behind and I did compliment her on her ass.  I assume at this point we were going into sexting mode.

She's technically my ex since we got into a MU (mutual understanding) relationship but that really didn't last long but my friend said MU relationships don't really count so yeah she's technically my ex but not really.

Anyways, after ""breaking up"" I still had a crush on her, and while I had a crush on her she had a crush on another guy, whom I don't exactly trust but according to her he's nice so I'll take her word for it. After a few weeks (or months I'm not really sure) her crush confessed on having feelings for her, so of course she did the same. After that, they were in a MU relationship. Now, before she had a crush on this guy, she and I would talk almost everyday. From morning, take a break since we have school (we attend different schools) and then talk in the afternoons. But after she and the guy confessed, we just suddenly stopped talking. She would try to make small talk here and there but everything just felt *dead* and it didn't have the same energy as before. During the times she would try making small talk with me, she would ask me help for captions for pictures. She wouldn't show them, she would just describe them and such. This happened two times, and in those two times she was just actually asking a caption for her MU to use, but I didn't know about it until the second time since her crush's brother and I are friends on Facebook and I saw his story with a picture that was exactly like the one she described. After that, I didn't feel like we were friends anymore. It felt like I was just there to boost herself in her relationship with her crush and that was the only reason she would chat me. Also I don't know if this is important but, I just don't feel that happy anymore every time I see her name, or when I chat with her. I would lose most of my energy and become bad vibes or not all that happy for the rest of the conversation and/or day. 

tl;dr - my crush and her crush confessed to each other, they are now MU. she would ask me to create captions not knowing it was for her MU.

The ring cost $5,000 and after the purchase, he now has $50 to his name.

Although I am truly grateful, I can't help but feel that he's being very financially irresponsible, especially given that he is currently unemployed with zero income. Furthermore, since proposal comes with, of course, the prospect of marriage, I can't help but be concerned that after we are married, all of his debts and poor financial decisions will be transferred onto me. This worries me greatly because he has always been bad with money as well.

I've tried multiple times to convince him to return the ring, or at least get something less expensive, but all he does is become extremely defensive and accuse me of ""not really wanting to marry him"" when that is 100% not the case. I've tried educating him on the dangers of accumulating interest on debt, and he also just dismisses it and says that he'll get a job and pay it off ""later"" when he doesn't have a job even lined up.

So I am traveling for work and have been for the last two months (Ill get back home in a few days).

I've been living with my roommate for almost two years now so he definitely knew of the responsibilities beforehand. 

now that all the backgrounds out of the way... since I was away for 7 weeks my roommate was fine with watching him the entire time but it turned out my girlfriend went back from home early and has been for nearly 4 weeks. I asked her when she told me she was going back if she would be uncharge of the dog since its kinda like ours, we've been dating for over a year now. She agreed but I've recently found out from my roommate that she hasn't really been doing anything to take care of him, besides taking him at random hours of the night to sleep with him and returning him right when she wakes up.

Mom and stepdad were married for almost 20 years, most of them rough. They divorced almost ten years ago, and while my stepdad is happily remarried, my mother is still single (and not happy about it). 

My mom and I are very close, but we’ve had a pretty rocky relationship over the years. She’s very generously offered to help pay for the wedding, and she recently asked me if I would consider letting her walk me down the aisle along with my stepdad. I told her I would consider it, which I am doing, but I’m feeling conflicted – mostly because she feels very competitive with my stepdad, and I’m concerned that this is a factor here.

cmw5b6,1565125417,AITA for not telling my boss her husband propositioned me?,"Several years ago (2011) I was at a bar and ran into a guy I'd gone to high school with. We chatted for a few minutes, no big deal. 

Later he added me on Facebook and messaged me saying that I'd looked really hot at the bar (I'm painfully average but drunk men aren't picky) and then proceeded to ask me to meet up with him and sleep with him. I told him I was married and he backed off.

Looked at his profile, and he was married too. Creeper. Awww man. Since he left me alone after I said no, I let it go.

A couple years later (2014) he messaged me again on Facebook, asking if we could hang out and catch up. I told him I wasn't into it. He was pretty insistent and then switched gears to talking about being dissatisfied at home, and again blatantly asked me to fuck him. I told him to focus on his family and ignored him.

I had never met his wife when any of this was happening.

Fast forward to about a year ago and I'm interviewing for a job and the hiring manager is this guy's wife. Didn't even realize it until she said ""oh, you graduated from [school] in [year], you must know my husband."" I honestly considered just not pursuing the job at that point but it's a good job, I knew I'd be good at it, she and I hit it off really well, and I hadn't heard anything from her husband in years.

I guess she mentioned it to him because he messaged me again and said ""my wife said you applied, I told her how smart you were in school and I hope she hires you!"" I said thanks. Left it at that, nothing inappropriate. After I was hired he messaged me again to say congrats and I said thanks. 

Occasionally he will stop by work to see her and we say hey to each other but he's not weird about it and has made no inappropriate contact with me since 2014. 

After working closely together for a year I consider my boss to be a good friend and what he did has shifted in my head from ""everyday creep"" to ""tried to betray someone important to me."" If he made a pass at me now, or I knew he was cheating or trying to, I'd tell her in a heartbeat. But since this was so long ago (and nothing ever happened) I still haven't told her.

I have no reason to believe telling her would affect my employment. It might make work awkward but I don't think she would be angry with me. I do feel like bringing it up now could potentially hurt her and their family. 

Knowing the ages of their kids and if I'm doing my math right, she would have been home with newborns during the times that he was trying to get laid and that just really makes me mad.

She speaks of him very fondly, seems very happy with her marriage, and has never indicated that she worries about him being interested in anyone else. For all I know he's never approached another woman like that, or it's something they've addressed and worked through.

What’s happened is that next week, I need to visit an embassy in London to get a visa for my holiday with my father. My parents have been divorced since I was 2 weeks old, and my mother has custody. I’m 16 now, male, and have Asperger’s Syndrome - notwithstanding this, I am very independent and am able to do many things unaided. 

My situation is that my father works in the South, as he lives in Wales - and it would be a logistical nightmare for him to travel up to Birmingham where I live, then back down to London - and it’d cost a lot also. My mom and dad have been speaking about this (of course, my mom not once asking me for my input). She told my dad that I was uncomfortable getting the train into and out of London (I didn’t say that once - the opposite in fact). I understand and acknowledge that London’s a big city, and that there’s crime there - which is why I agreed to meeting my father at Euston. However, that’s all I said. Not once did I say that I was uncomfortable getting on the train. Don’t get me wrong - I love my mom to bits - she’s really an amazing mom - but I sometimes wish I could be more independent without her taking an almost helicopter parent approach. Am I the asshole for wanting to be more independent?

c5smap,1561569812,AITA for not defending a transwoman after she was repeatedly attacked by our group president?,"Throwaway acct.

Yesterday at work 4 of us were having a conversation about Diversity & Inclusion projects. The group :Me, a coworker, Executive Director (Sharon)and our group President (Steve). Sharon & Steve are both in elected positions, and hold a lot of power in our organisation. Steve is basically my boss’s boss.

Sharon was saying how she regretted that she did not invite any trans people to an LGBTQ+ event she hosted. One of our members, Samantha, is a transwoman and she does great work. I love Samantha- she’s kind & funny and is a powerful spokesperson. 

I suggested that we connect with her and Sharon immediately agreed. Then Steve jumped in and said: “Oh is that the guy that sits in the back corner?” 

That’s where Samantha sits so I knew he was referring to her. 

“She, yes, Samantha is her name- SHE is great, very knowledgeable—-“ But Steve cut me off:
“ He’s probably got a good perspective.”
“She,” both Sharon and I corrected again.
“Oh well I don’t know how to address these things” Steve said. “How do I know if he’s a man or a woman or whatever?”
“She,” I interrupted for a third time. “She’s a woman- her name is Samantha. That’s what I’m saying.”
But Steve wasn’t really listening because he just sort of talked over me: “Okay, okay I’ll just say ‘THEY.’ that way I don’t make a mistake. I mean how can I know these things? I mean- he looks like a guy to me.”

I was flabbergasted. I’m not sure how the conversation ended but none of us called Steve out on being so shitty. And I felt terribly afterward. 

Just to be clear Samantha is noticeably a transwoman. She dresses impeccably in feminine clothing (you know what I mean pls don’t word police me!) her makeup is always on point- she is presenting herself to the world as a woman. So I just don’t believe that Steve was genuinely confused about her gender. If he was, he could have corrected himself the first time - instead of continuing on that awful& disrespectful diatribe,  flinging his hands up in the air in this cartoonish motion of confusion.

It’s especially poignant because we were talking about Samantha in the context of being inclusive so I’m now concerned about Steve’s commitment to our stated values.

I feel ashamed for not saying more yesterday. But I’m not sure what I can do now.

As we alternate weeks, she has asked me to continue the grounding at my place, and when I said that I'd planned on buying him a beer to celebrate turning 18 she said that I couldn't do that while he was being grounded, and I should wait until the month was over.

However, I have never set punishments that intrude on her time with him, I've always dealt with them in my week, and also from what she said of the argument, he was right. I know we're meant to be on the same side here but the argument, in short, from her own admission, was that he wanted to do another extracurricular with his friends and she said no because it would take away from his homework time, which I feel is an odd argument given that our son is a straight A student and can handle another extracurricular. The swear that got him grounded was when he said ""I'm not allowed to do fucking anything"", so it wasn't like he swore at her directly.

I'm torn on this because while I feel the punishment doesn't fit the crime, she's also been on my back lately for making myself the ""fun parent"". I have a bit more by way of income than she does so while she has to stick to a shopping list and meal plan each week I'm able to ask our son what he wants for dinner and get takeout every now and again, and our son hasn't said anything to me but she says he's indicated to her that he prefers being with me at my place.

As he exits the vehicle, I tell him that he's parked in a crosswalk.  I use the calmest tone possible as I know mistakes are easy to make; he could have just not been aware.  He tells me ""I've just been in an accident, go around"".  I look at the car, and at him, and I see no damage to the car or the man or anything serious going on.  I understand that being in an accident is still incredibly stressful and he could have had injuries that I just didn't see, even if he didn't appear to be injured.  The fact that he told me he was just in an accident is what makes me question whether I'm the asshole.  Still keeping my calm tone, I said ""Yes, but you're parked directly in a crosswalk, could you kindly pull your car forward a little bit.""  There's a large driveway that could easily fit his car about fifteen feet ahead of him.  He continues to refuse.  I get stubborn about it because I think that it compromises my safety and the safety of others if they want to cross.  It seems trivial, but being hit by a car is definitely not trivial, and having to walk out from behind a car parked in a crosswalk, to me, definitely makes crossing in an already dangerous spot all the more dangerous.  

&#x200B;

I take a step back so that I don't seem like I'm trying to start a confrontation with the driver and think it over.  I see a fireman who's come to assess the accident not far away, who doesn't seem to be busy.  I walk up to him and ask him if he could please ask this man to pull his car forward out of the crosswalk.  He seems hesitant, and tells me I could ask him.  I explain what just happened.  After this, he asks the gentleman to pull his car forward.  He says ""Oh, you'd like me to move forward?"" and quickly does so.  I cross and go home.

&#x200B;

It might seem silly but the whole interaction had me anxious to the point of shaking.  I've been cycling through whether or not I did the right thing, or I harassed a man who had just gotten into an accident unnecessarily.   So what do you guys think?  AITA?",False,asshole,7,14,1
cc2m01,1562885518,AITA for banning my daughter from bringing her girlfriend to her room??,"Hello there, I am a 50 y/o male with three wonderful children. The youngest is 17 (Fiona) and just recently got into a relationship with a nice girl in her grade (Jasmine). 

Jasmine is very nice and I can tell she makes my daughter happy so i have no problems with them being together. 

Jasmine and my daughter Fiona spend a lot of time at my house, usually playing video games, etc. I’m a software engineer and usually spend time in our computer room which is downstairs.

Yesterday Jasmine was over, and  I went into the living room to say hello but noticed neither of them were there. I went upstairs and saw my daughters room was closed with the light on so I knocked and heard some swearing and shuffling of clothes.

My daughter opens the door, fully clothed, but I could tell she had just thrown her clothes back on in a hurry. I said hello to jasmine and quickly left back to the computer room. Shortly afterwards Jasmine left and my daughter tried to leave as well but I called her into the room.

I told her that while I like Jasmine a lot and am happy for her that i don’t want her having sex in my house until she is at least 18, and that her and jasmine can’t be alone in her room anymore.  My daughter flips out and calls me homophobic and that I don’t respect her privacy. She stormed upstairs and slammed the door shut and refuses to talk to me. 

My wife came home and when I told her what had happened she called me an asshole and that if I banned her from having sex here she would just do it somewhere else.

I know that I probably should’ve set boundaries when they first got together but I want her to be sure she’s making a good decision and I’m worried that she’s not that educated on sex with another girl yet. AITA here? If so how do I fix it ??


UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who responded just thought I’d update with the current situation and clarify a bit. 

The rules I set for my daughter also applied for her older siblings and they would be the same if she was dating a boy. However I am aware that if I don’t let them have sex here they probably will do it somewhere else which worries me even more. 

I sat my daughter down and explained to her that I would prefer for her to be 18 before doing anything but that she is almost an adult and capable of making her own decisions. I made sure to let her know that if she wanted to and if she was happy that It would be fine in my house. Just..not when I’m literally downstairs.",1562904340.0,not the asshole,9,32,0

So of course he is busy trying to make the right decisions for us, and can’t really be bothered with making other types of decisions. I tried to talk to him about what he would like to do for his birthday and he just couldn’t give me any answers. Fair enough, I totally get that. So I decide to make plans for him myself.

We have three kids. Oldest is 7 and youngest is 7 months. We can’t exactly do things on a whim and need to definitely plan it out in advance, especially if we want to do it without the kids.

So I decide to get a sitter for Friday evening (he works Sat-Wed). I got REALLY nice tickets to a local baseball game (which he LOVES to attend!) I asked him BEFORE I bought the tickets if this is a good idea and he said “yes thanks!” GREAT! Green light given!

Then I remembered that it’s my Dad’s birthday too (their birthdays are 4 days a part). They get along pretty well. So I figured, hey maybe two birds one stone? Neither my dad or husband like to be fussed about on their birthdays but definitely appreciate doing a little thing. So I asked husband if he would mind if I had my dad tag along with us for the game. He said he didn’t care. I asked again, and said “This first and foremost is your birthday present, so I just want to make sure you are OK with this, it’s your decision” and he just kind of brushed it off again. I asked again a few days later. He responded he didn’t care again. Alright, he can’t be bothered to make these little decisions and he says he doesn’t care, so I invited my dad. 

My dad is VERY excited about going to the game too. So I set up the baby sitter for the kids. I work until 5. Sitter comes at 6. Game starts at 7. 

Tomorrow is the game. This morning, husband said to me “How about we skip the game, and go to dinner and a movie instead?” I asked why. He said “The game doesn’t start until 7, it probably won’t end until 9. I have to be up early for work” I said “Okay but I am not sure how dinner and a movie would get us home earlier? We don’t have a sitter until 6. And I already got the tickets to the game. And I already invited my dad”. 

His face dropped. He said “I thought that was MY decision?” I said “Well it was, but you just kept saying you didn’t care, and I figured you really didn’t care, so I invited him”

He stopped talking and just said “k”. I can tell he is upset. I said “I’m sorry but I did try to ask what you wanted. I had to make a decision and this was what I decided.” And he just continued to not respond to me (yes this was in PERSON) and then I had to go to work. So we haven’t been able to talk since.

c8htav,1562116685,AITA for refusing the be at my work station 5 min before my shift starts?,"English isn't my first language, and I'm on mobile, and autocorrect can be an ass, so apologies for any mistakes.


Hey folks,


I know this might sound like a really minor and nitpicky issue, but it's annoying me a great deal.


I'm a student, I've got a part time job of 10-20 hours a week next to my studies. In my country, it's normal (I think in general, but at least as far as I know for teen/student jobs) to ask them to be in 10-5 min before their shifts start.


This is extremely annoying to me. The reason my employer wants me to be in 5 min early is so that the colleague I'm taking over from can inform me about anything I need to know that happened so far that day and to discuss tasks that need to be done. However, the way I see it, if I have to be there 5 min early for that, then that is _work_ time.


I try to arrive on time (as in, 5 min before the official start of my shift) but often I end up being there, idk, 2-4 min before the start (I never am at my work station later than my official start time). However, my colleagues will sometimes complain to me that I'm not 5 min early, and as a result they 'have to stay a few min longer to still discuss the stuff with me' (although, this rarely takes more than a minute to talk about). I'm not exaggerating when I say that me being not exactly 5 min early has almost never resulted in a colleague staying a bit later, and in the (max 3-5 over the last half year) cases that it has, it might have been 1-2 min.


Im not claiming their time is less valueable than mine. My point is rather that if anyone has to stay longer for their work (be it me coming 5 min early for the shift transfer, or them 'staying later' for the shift transfer) they should get paid for their time.


In terms of monetary impact, I have on average 3 shifts per week I think. 3x5min = 15 min. 15*45(random, low estimate of weeks) =675 min =11 hours. That'd be around 150 euro a year that I'd be missing out on. Might not seem like much, but it's (obviously) mainly about the principle, and for a student €150 is still quite a nice amount.


So, I just cant really be bothered to make the effort to show up early enough to be at my station exactly 5min early.

brv15f,1558563205,AITA for pronouncing French words like I would in French?,"Hi Reddit,

Longtime lurker, bear with me please!

Background: I speak French fluently because I went to French school (in the USA, 90% of the curriculum was exclusively in French) from PreK-12th grade. A lot of my friends are French, and to date we still speak in French when we get together(I'm in my late 20s for context). My parents, while not French, live in France, and I visit them at least once a year. I have French extended family. I watch French TV, read in French, and just generally have French stuff happening around me because it has been part of my life since I can remember.

I don't bring this up randomly to people, bc I think that would be kind of douchey to unnecessarily volunteer this info that is irrelevant to my day to day life. However, all my close friends know about my connection to French/France, and laugh at me when I get drunk and can't remember certain words in ENGLISH.

Onto the issue...this past Sunday, I met up with a new(ish) friend for dinner & drinks. Things were going fine, until she asked me what I had done that weekend, to which I replied ""I made crêpes for breakfast yesterday (Saturday)."" I pronounced the word ""crêpes"" the way I learned to say it and the way I routinely say it, which phonetically sounds kinda like ""cr-epp-s."" She proceeded to ask me what those were, and I told her they were French, thin pancakes that you can eat with butter and sugar (like I did) or with more elaborate fillings. 

She then went on to say, oh, do you mean, ""cray-ps?"" (in the typical American pronunciation.) I said yes, exactly! She looked super confused, then weirdly offended, and proceeded to ask me why I felt the ""need"" to sound so ""pretentious"" when talking about them. I replied saying I wasn't being pretentious, I was just pronouncing this food the way a) it is pronounced by the people who routinely make/eat it, b) the way I routinely say it, since I speak French. She then stated that I should be pronouncing French foods the ""American"" way when I speak about it in America, and not doing so is rude and stuck-up. I said I didn't agree, told her I've always pronounced it that way, then resumed our conversation. Dinner was a little awkward from there on out. 

Reddit, AITA? I don't feel like this is any different from a Polish-speaking person pronouncing pierogi in Polish, or a Spanish-speaking person pronouncing mole in Spanish. I would get it if I was pretending to sound like I knew the word, but I told her that I speak the damn language! I wouldn't be super bummed if this person didn't become a long-term friend, but I just feel weird about this whole situation.",False,not the asshole,841,552,0
cwi3gn,1566982472,AITA for arguing with my dad for suggesting I help out my cousin?,"I work for a social media marketing company that usually helps restaurants all over the U.S. improve their online presence and translate Internet traffic into foot traffic in store with the onset of things like foodies on Instagram. My dad knows about this and we often discuss how my work day goes and such. 

Recently, a cousin from my dad’s side opened a cafe and my dad suggested that I help run their social media since they would probably need some assistance getting the cafe exposure. I told him I agreed that good social media marketing would help get the cafe some legs to stand on but that I wouldn’t do it for free. My dad got a little upset by this and asked why not? I replied that I would essentially be doing free labor for them, and that I wouldn’t have the benefit of a lot of the resources I have with my job that helps me balance running multiple clients’ social media. 

He said that helping my cousin would be good practice for my job and that if things worked out for them, they could help me get exposure for my work with other businesses; he thinks that would lead to me being able to start my own social media marketing company. I stood firm with my argument that I would still essentially be performing free labor for them, but that I would be willing to help them as a sort of consultant since they’re family. However, he was still upset that I wouldn’t help run their social media as a favor because they’re family and so he ended the argument with a huff. 

I understand that he was just bringing up the suggestion as a way to possibly help me with my job and advance my career and that it wasn’t a definitive thing, but it seemed like he was just oversimplifying the fact that I would be working for my cousin for free.

8z5ua7,1531695700,AITA for sleeping with someone 3 weeks after a relationship ended?,"I'm on mobile, so I'll try to keep this concise and not include any unnecessary details. Apologies for any less-than-ideal formatting.

My ex-girlfriend (age 18) and I (age 17) had been dating for a little over a year. It was the first long,  serious relationship for both of us. However, due to her leaving for college at the end of the summer and an agreement that a long-distance relationship wasn't for us, we both agreed to break up. She's a coworker at one of my jobs, and we still got along fine and were generally friendly. I figured it was great that we were still friendly and all was well.

3 weeks after we broke up, one of my friends had a party. My friend invited one of my ex's friends, and my ex asks if she can come too (she knew I was at the party). After giving it some thought I decide that's not a good idea and my friend politely says that since I'm here he'd prefer not to make it awkward and for her not to come. Neither her or her friend showed up, and the party was fine.

At the party, I became intoxicated and slept with another girl (age 17 who works at the job where my ex and I both work). This was a pretty fucking stupid idea. I think that I don't regret the act, but I very much regret the things that occurred from it.

It was rather naive of me to assume that my ex girlfriend wouldn't find out about this. A day or so after, I received a text from her asking if I had slept with the other girl. I decided to be completely honest and told her that I had. Apparently she had found out at work when the other girl had told another coworker. She went off on me, saying that I was the worst human ever, that she hates me and wishes she had never met me, and that I should never contact her or see her in person again. I also got flak from her brother, who texted me later saying how stupid and insensitive I was.

When I was at the party, I thought that such a thing would be a moral gray area at worst. I figured that I wouldn't really be upset if she did something like that (especially since she had mentioned at work to me that she was already getting hit on by several people), so she wouldn't really be bothered if I did it. Looking back on it, I know she probably still had feelings for me, and that I really offended her and devalued our whole relationship, which wasn't my intent at all. I cherish the relationship that we had and it holds a special place in my heart, and it hurts me to see that in her and her family's mind I pissed away a year of respect and love in an act that occurred 3 weeks after we broke up. This is where my deep regret lies, and it's probably the thing I regret the most so far in my life.

In addition to a broken relationship with her and her brother, she told her parents about it (who used to really like me), and they told mine. Her parents told my parents to tell me to stay away from both of them, which really stung. I'm facing a lot of repercussions for my dumbassery that I feel like I deserve. My parents are having me resign from my job that she works at, as well.

I don't really know what to think about this. Was my initial interpretation of the whole situation assholeish? Am I an asshole, or is this blown out of proportion? I imagine it's some of both, but I would much appreciate an outsider's perspective as I move forward with this and try to become a better person.",False,not the asshole,46,43,0

This gas station usually plays host to a group of older men in the mornings who like to come play cribbage and drink coffee that the management gives them for free.

One  particular man, who for the rest of the post will be referred to as M,  has never worked for our location, nor any other location in our chain. However, He constantly speaks to myself and the other younger  members of our staff as though he is our supervisor. When he isn't doing  this, he is simply making rude or snide comments about us either  directly to us or to the others in his group.

Simply put, M comes in every day, and after he's done with cribbage, fills our coolers if something is low. He has to go back into what would normally be employee only areas to do this most of the time, and is very nasty to the rest of the staff about it.

With  all the context out of the way, I go in to work one day to find that the general manager had  to come in to cover the morning shift.  We switch tills, and while the GM is  going back to take midday count of her till and our slot machine payout  funds, M comes up to me and tells me, word for word, ""Now I went around  and filled up all those coolers, and they'd BETTER look like that when I  come in in the morning.""

Frustrated, I  go to the GM and essentially  said that I'm sick of M speaking to me like he's my boss, and that he  shouldn't really be doing anything that he does around here in the first  place, even if it can be helpful sometimes. My boss, likely frustrated  already considering she shouldn't have had to be there that day, told me  that she was thrust into that shift, and that they were swamped in the  morning, so he was just helping her out. I told him what he had said to  me and she told me, quote, ""It's not always about you. And sometimes  people on the night shift, not you, but people on the night shift leave  the coolers empty. Ron's just being helpful so you'll just have to learn  to ignore him."" I decided not to press further after that, frustrated.

Within this statement,  there's the implication that I, as practically the only night shift  worker we have, do not fill the coolers properly at night. I fill the  coolers to the point where they look full every night before I leave,  but if there are three or more bottle in a row, or the cans/bottles are  large and bulky like Arizona tea cans or tall 38 oz cans, I typically  leave them. I also don't fill the rows completely, because as stated  above, pushing the bottles/cans all the way to the back results in them  falling behind the shelves entirely, or makes the more top heavy bottles  fall over and out of the coolers when they're meant to slide down.

I had all the points i have earned divided by the possible points i could have earned to receive an A Which is great so I didnt have to take the final.   

I received an email from him telling me ""As per the syllabus, you have earned an A grade in the course. Your superlative performance relieves you from taking the final in the course as scheduled."" So i decided to pack all my things since I had no more finals and to head home. I received another email form him telling me my math was wrong and my new grade is about an 80% and I need to show up for the final tomorrow or Ill receive a 0.

She told me her friend, K, who is about the same age as her, needed help with some internet stuff and asked if I'd do it as a favor. I was unemployed at the time so I said sure.

I went over to see what K needed. K was pretty grumpy and a very avid trump supporter, which my friend did not think to warn me about. I am gay and was living in a small town so this is a group of people I generally try to avoid. K didn't say anything rude to me but I was pretty tense. She basically needed help putting her small business up for sale on a couple local sale boards, would not have taken me a long time at all. She gave me some of her basic information and we planned a day where I could sit down and help her.

That day comes around, I text K to ask if we're still meeting, she tells me she's busy and to plan another day. This happens one or two times. Eventually I lose contact with her. Then I start a new full time job and am not around my hometown very often anymore. She texts me after a month asking if I can still help her. I basically told her no I am busy with work now and blocked her number, never heard from her again. My old lady friend has never brought it up to me again, so I think she may have forgotten.

cjz9yf,1564525985,AITA for wanting to speak up about pervasive history of my sister in laws new boyfriend?,"My sister in law has been dating this guy for a couple months. She kept it under wraps for awhile, little hints here and there that she was dating. Had no clue it was a guy I used to work with. We went to her sons bday party this last weekend and he was there with her and the first time my husband and I have seen them together. 
I used to work with this guy for almost 3 years and I know A LOT about him, including some not so good things, one of those being that he’s a bully to women. We don’t get along. 
He recently got divorced, has two kids, and sister in law is divorced with two kids, similar in age. 
So when I first started working with him, he was my first “trainer” meaning he was showing me the ropes of the register/store/how to stock etc. He criticized me on Day 2 for “not being more like him and to speak up louder when talking to people,” mind you he’s a grown man and I’m a grown woman. I didn’t appreciate the comment, and nonetheless it created palpable tension from the get go as I simply told him “I cannot be like you, everyone has their own style.” He didn’t like that I responded at all.
Flash forward to one year later, and another female coworker confided in me that herself and the guy in question has been sleeping together for years. She told me intrepid details that I could’ve lived without, like what his playlist consists of when they have sex-but she was seeking advice in how to end it because she felt like a home wrecker. Mind you-he’s married this whole time. Their relationship is still going today as far as I know, and I know this because I have very good friends who still work there, and see them together all the time. Also, they take trips together, and accidentally give away that they are going together-by giving away details to coworkers of their “separate” trip that they’re actually taking together. 
The final crux of our relationship ended at work when he came up behind me, leaned into my ear (I was distracted as I had just rung up a customer) and YELLED my full name into my ear. I have VERY sensitive ears, and my instinct was to elbow whoever it was immediately. I didn’t put it together until after I elbowed him in the throat, that it was him and not some crazy customer trying to mess with me. He went to the manager and complained, to which I just relayed my side of the story, and they wrote it off. Didn’t write him up, didn’t really do anything but tell him to stop. Better than nothing I guess. I was livid, and discontinued talking to him for the remainder of my time there while still keeping it cordial saying hi and bye on occasion. 
Here’s my question-AITA if I say something to the sister in law or her mother about him being a bully, womanizer, and serial cheater? My husband has already said that the guy had a bad reputation to his mother, but I don’t feel like that’s enough, without details.

b4ylk4,1553446889,AITA for implementing a strict food policy at work?,"For context, my workplace is a very small (about 100ft^2 or ~9.3m^2) outbuilding, and only accommodates 2 people (three is stretching it) people at a time. We only have about 5 people who work throughout the week, so it’s a very small department both in terms of space and people.

Recently I have been absolutely disgusted by the way my coworkers leave our space. Food in boxes and bags left for weeks at a time until it expires. Drinks untouched after a few swallows. Fresh fruit left rotting in the back room. And that’s just the uneaten stuff. I think I’m the only one who sweeps or mops spills off the floor and cleans off the counters and desk.

I have been asking nicely for everyone to clean up after themselves and to not leave food in the building unless they really need to do so (one person is diabetic) for over six months. Yet everything I listed before was still a regular occurrence. And so I finally broke. I’m tired of cleaning up other people’s messes when they are too lazy to clean up after themselves after repeatedly being asked to do so.

So I instituted a new food policy. If you leave food in the building after you leave and it is unopened, it will be put on a shelf for you to collect. If it hasn’t been collected or opened by the end of the week, it’s thrown out. If open food or fresh fruit is left behind, it gets thrown out the next day. The same goes for drinks.

I think this is fair, but everyone who works here is saying this is way too harsh, and I am out of line. AITA here?

EDIT: I made an exception for our diabetic coworker, since they need quick access to certain foods; they have a designated area to leave their food and drink. And over the summer, we have a cooler with communal cold drinks (Gatorade and water, mostly).

All I said was that I'd appreciate it if he cut his nails in the bathroom or even better, do it at home. It is pretty gross to hear the clipping and even more disgusting to see it. He got really defensive and said that he doesn't notice his nail length at home, only when he gets into the office. 

A few days later, he's clipping again, and all I said this time was ""dude, come on"". His defense? I put on chapstick and eye drops at my desk, why can't he cut his nails? I told him that chapstick and eye drops don't fly onto his desk. He can't seem to understand what he's doing is gross.

Side note, I'm Chinese American and he is constantly talking about politics, especially the HK-China tension. Most of my family is from HK so everything he's saying about exterminating HKers is very offensive to me. I finally reported his nail cutting and offensive HK comments to HR. 

My boss gets wind of this and meets with us separately. He is on my side, and says this guy is weird. However, he cannot let him go because my complaints are not egregious enough to get him fired. Apparently, comments about exterminating my people are not enough.

One of the friends, we’ll call her Abigail, has a severe peanut allergy. Not to the extent where she can’t be in the same room as peanut products, but she has to avoid skin contact and obviously no consumption. I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches relatively frequently during lunch, probably about once or twice a week.  Abigail has told me that when peanuts or peanut butter are near her, her face gets itchy and she begins to feel uncomfortable. She says that's the extent of it though, and its not a true allergic reaction.

Almost every time I’m eating peanut butter, she says something along the lines of “I can feel that you’re eating peanut butter”, kind of jokingly, but, I think, also kind of annoyed. I always apologize and she just says “it’s okay”, but I don’t know how much she actually cares. We have a great friendship otherwise and nothing about peanuts, peanut butter, or allergies is every brought up outside of lunch time.

I don’t want to make her feel itchy and uncomfortable, but I love peanuts and peanut butter is a staple of my lunches. If she was having a true allergic reaction I clearly would stop eating peanuts around her, but since it just makes her feel uncomfortable itchy, I haven’t stopped.

The mother and the rest of the family was there and no one really batted an eye. The step dad wasn't there. On top of this, I heard the mother say in front of the kid that ""you were great until you started talking"", ""go away"", ""I don't want you here"". 

I admit the kid is known to be annoying but apparently at school they are very well behaved. It's only at home that they behave 'like this'.

__________________________________________________

Hi guys, so this is my first post ever. I’ve been a long time lurker and upvoter, but this quandary has forced me to finally sign up for an account. 

A little backstory- my very good friend is getting married next year and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I was initially hesitant because I’m not American and I wasn’t sure about what my responsibilities would be. I was upfront about my questions and told her I needed some time to research it, which she was completely fine with. She even said she appreciated that I didn’t say yes immediately. In my culture weddings are a very different affair from what I’ve seen the weddings here are like, but I love my friend to bits (we are like family now) and I wanted to be there for her in an official capacity, so I agreed. 

So we’ve been talking about bridesmaid dresses and for the longest time she was very clear that she wanted us to all wear a single colour, but for us to choose our own dresses. Dresses that showcased our own design sense and that we would be able to wear again. We were all in agreement over this- until 2 days ago when she said she’s found the perfect dress for all of us and sent us a link. 

This dress is SO body con that it looks like it’s been spray painted onto the model. Guys. I just can’t. This is SO FAR out of my comfort zone.  I have never worn something like this in my life. I panicked and quickly sent her a few other option that were similar styles, but more forgiving (as a private message, not in the bridesmaid group chat)

She blew up at me and basically said she changed her mind about us having different dresses and has been so stressed about about this and I should just buy a larger size if I’m so conscious and she will lend me shapewear. And that it’s only for the ceremony and pictures and then I can change.

Now I completely understand that this is a box she needs to tick and not think about again. And also that she genuinely loves the dress and thinks we will all look good in it. But I feel like I’m being forced to wear a bikini or be naked. Because that’s how tight it is. That’s just the style. If I buy the largest size possible it’s just going to look awful. As awful as wearing the correct size. 

I’m so torn about this. I don’t don’t want to seem like a selfish asshole, but I draw the line at this. How should I handle it? 

And also, her husband to be updated his Facebook status this morning after my chat with her, saying he couldn’t understand how one selfish person can ruin it all for so many people. I’m pretty sure he’s talking about me and I’m really hurt.",1566778557.0,not the asshole,533,168,0

We have a FANTASTIC bagel place near my house, and we decided to get some bagels and go to my house. The line at the bagel place is always long, so they have a separate line for those who just want to purchase bagels (untoasted, with no butter or cream cheese).

We got a couple everything bagels, and then stopped at the store and I got dairy-free cream cheese and he got dairy butter. 

Long story short, we went to my house, ate our bagels, and then he asked me if I could simply keep the rest of the butter in my fridge for the next time he comes over.

I instantly refused by saying “I’m sorry but I’m not comfortable with that.” He called me overly sensitive and demanded that I keep the butter in my fridge, to which I said no. It goes without saying that he left my house pretty soon.

 I also said that I understand you gain some weight dealing with thyroid issues but not enough to become morbidly obese. That it’s very rare to have a health problem that makes you gain enough weight to be THAT overweight, and hypothyroidism definitely isn’t one of them. At some point people have to acknowledge that some weight gained is their fault and not their disease. She started crying and told me I was fat shaming her, and my friend agreed.

d2iakp,1568165258,AITA for ignoring my mom to avoid my dad,"I’m of Korean descent so a lot of our traditional culture has to do with being very respectful to people older than us and using the honorifics system to denote social/familial status and relationships, but anyways…

I was on the phone with my Mom, and I talk very casually with her, which is probably one of the reasons we're so close. We always have these jokey play-arguments about random stuff, and I’m also usually complaining about the mundane aspects of college life. Sometimes we can get heated, but we both understand that half of it is her and I venting to each other about our lives outside of the family and within it. Kind of out of nowhere my Dad took my mom’s phone to interrupt our call and aggressively chewed me out about how disrespectfully I address my Mom.

I was so shocked I couldn't even speak, a lot of emotions of shame, guilt, sadness, and defeat came rushing up, which are emotions I haven’t felt so strongly since leaving home. I’m sure he loves me, but he’s a very typical distant Dad. He also wasn’t raised to behave casually towards his parents, so he genuinely thinks my mom and I are fighting and feels I’m being disrespectful. All in all, I ended my phone call with my mom while sobbing my eyes out.  I've also been privately dealing with depression for a few years now and was finally feeling a sense of motivation because of my work, new friends, professors, etc. She added before she hung up that my dad may be aggressive and critical to me, but that he’s so proud of me, and talks about me a lot, which I have so personal experience of.

Now my mom is texting me if it's a good time to talk and asking me if I’m ignoring her now (this happened last night and she texted me today).

I haven't responded. I understand she just wants to navigate the issues between me and him, but honestly I know as soon as I talk to her, my dad’s just going to eavesdrop on our conversation /she’s going to tell him everything we talked about. She’s also going to try to explain my dad’s action and get me to forgive him. I want to talk to her too, but I’m so emotionally shaken right now, and it’s barely been a day since this happened. For right now, I don't want him to know anything about me, I don't want him to know what I'm up to, how I've been doing, what I've been doing. Knowing that to talk to my mom, my dad will be lurking and be excused of everything, makes me kind of sick, like he's silently judging me from across the country.

I'm sick of him constantly misunderstanding my every action and word, I’m sick of feeling guilty and depressed, I’m sick of forgiving him without apologies, and I don’t even want to think about it anymore. I've been feeling like I'm gonna throw up for the past twenty-four hours.

But I also love my mom, and I don't want to shut her out.

TLDR; Have to ignore my caring mom to avoid my distant dad.

Never before has a television show from my country been internationally popular, so maybe I’m being overly sensitive because of this, but I asked him extra-nicely if he would please be quite while it’s on, as it is culturally very important to me and is only on for 20 minutes.

He talked the whole way through it and then called me selfish when I told him to please PLEASE be quiet, just for 20 minutes because I didn’t want to miss any dialogue. He was talking about stuff that wasn’t even to do with the programme.

dcxv8k,1570139615,AITA for refusing to visit a friend's apartment due to concerns about bedbugs?,"Names changed, 

ages: mid-20s 

My best friend Jane and her partner John recently got their first 'adult' apartment (not student housing, no roommates). Rent is higher, but they decided they could swing it, it would just mean lower disposable income. I helped them move in and visited a few times. 

Recently Jane told me that they have bedbugs. It turns out that the whole building has had a problem for years (as evidenced by online reviews). The landlord will pay for shoddy treatments and then not really do anything about it. Jane and John likely got them during a fire safety inspection when inspectors moved between apartments. 

Jane is obviously upset, she gets the landlord's free treatment, it doesn't work, and she asks me what she should do. At this point I do a bit of research, find out how easy bedbugs are to get, how hard they are to shake, etc. In my head I decide I don't ever want to set foot in Jane's apartment building ever again. 

As Jane is pretty sensitive, I held off telling her at first, vainly hoping for some magic solution. Eventually she asked me to help her bring a new mattress into the apartment (which still has bedbugs). When I refused, I finally told her, as gently as possible, that while I was still her friend, I did not want to visit her at home. 

I reiterated that it was not her fault, that I was sorry, and that I would happily hang out with her at other locations like coffee shops, outings etc. 

Jane became very upset and said things showing she thought I was TA.

Selected quotes from Jane: 

""Why are you doing this to me?""

""You are too uptight.""

""You should just get over it""

“It seems like you are ending the friendship/threatening the friendship”

“It seems like you don’t care about my feelings.”

She also noted that a few of her other friends have visited her and just laundered their clothes and showered afterwards, indicating that that would be a (still hurtful but acceptable) compromise from her perspective. 

I still don’t want to visit, even once she manages to get a harsher treatment and (hopefully) rid her place of bedbugs. I have heard that it can take months to confirm if an infestation is truly gone. If the whole building has a problem, what’s to stop them coming back without them realizing it? Also, laundering everything I bring to her place doesn’t seem feasible, especially for things like coats and bags which might not be easily washable. 

She is unlikely to move for at least a year due to the lease and tight budget. 

She likes to have people over and would probably invite me over at minimum 1x/week. 

I also don’t really want her to visit me, as it would be easy to accidentally bring bedbugs via bags, jackets, and other things that don’t get washed regularly. 

Bedbugs terrify me.

He's says its been six years and I want to see you all the time without having to worry about when you have to get home. He also always brings up the fact that this way we can have sex all the time (I honestly don't give a shit about sex as much as he does).

I want to live with him too but I want to live alone for a bit before that. I want to life with myself, I understand it is overrated (as my bf keeps saying) and want to discover myself. My parents are extremely controlling and my mom is very dependent on me and I am counting down the days till I can get out. 

I even came up with a compromise and said I will get an apartment nearby but basically spend most of my days with you. This compromise also helps me with my parents as they don't approve of my relationship anyway and the imminent conflict of me moving in with him is unavoidable otherwise. I'd really like to do this as peacefully as possible. 

I'm excited about the little things like decorating my room (was never allowed to do it), eating whatever I want (my mom doesn't eat meat so we don't eat meat in the house but I like chicken and eggs) and other little things like buying groceries for myself, cooking (I love cooking but my mom doesn't like with I make EVER so it really annoys me to cook when she's around).

bvuy79,1559460381,AITA to cut off my mother for blowing 40k of money that wasn't hers?,"Sorry for how long this is, I'm just really conflicted and am having a hard time.

tldr; my mother thinks I am the biggest AH in the world because I cut her off for her behavior towards myself, my brother, our father, and her family. She blew $40k of money that wasn’t hers and got onto some really bad habits.

\-

After my brother and I moved out, my mother decided to leave my father for abuse that he did during their marriage of 30 years. She left and moved in with her bf, who she was dating before she left. She then ‘borrowed’ over $25k from my dad over the last year to ‘help get by’.

Context: They are still not divorced. She asked him for money even after she was living with another man.

'Help get by' means money to buy a four-wheeler to go camping with her new boyfriend (something she never wanted to do with us), eating out when she had a phone bill she wasn't paying her rent, and gas for the car to drive around. That’s not including the $15k that she got from my aunt because the rest wasn’t enough.

No one knows where all the money went. All we know is that over $40k is just gone in less than a year. Not to mention the drug habit she picked up from her new bf.

When she visited us a few weeks ago, I reached a breaking point. She showed up high bc she snorted a percocet in the plane bathroom and had alcohol on top of it. She did it knowing that she’d be around my 7 year old cousin who was visiting.

That night when we finally got home, I catch a liquefied pill leak from her nose. She claimed that it was for her back pain. I asked her why she didn’t just take it normally and she couldn’t give me a straight answer. I demanded that she refrain from it while in our house.

After seeing just how sick my mother was getting, I asked everyone to stop giving her money. This cascaded into my mother having a complete meltdown. She has to feel rock bottom otherwise nothing’s gonna change. We're forcing her to sink or swim.

Then my brother called me and told me that she had asked his fiance’ and her parents for money. That was it. I paid out of my own pocket to get her on an earlier flight and sent her back home early. I kicked her out of our house.

Then I got a call from a long time friend a couple days ago. Mom had gone on FB asking everyone she knew for money. Including my friend and her mom. I called my mom and ranted about how embarrassed and ashamed I was. She called my friend a coward for contacting me instead of her to get the ‘real story’.

It was my breaking point. I just said, ""The person you are now isn't my mother. When you figure out how to be her again, let me know. I love you. Bye."" She hasn't tried to contact me since, but she’s been telling people how mean I am.

It's been heartbreaking to hear all these things she’s said. I just don't know what to do.

We only see everybody together once every couple months. 

A couple hours in, most of everyone at the table is finished, and we all are talking. Everything was going fine until my brother brings up how a distant relative of ours just bought a very expensive car (around $300k). Everybody, including myself was very proud of him being able to do so. 

For some background info: None of our close family has ever been even close to rich. Everyone else at the table lives a “normal” middle class life. 

Then, my brother mentions that none of us at the table will ever be able to achieve that level of success and we’ll only ever be able to attain max an Audi or a BMW in our lifetime (practically anything under $50k).

I say that’s not necessarily an indicator of success anyway because many people buy luxury cars like Audi, BMW, and Mercedes all of the time and they can’t afford them. But they do it anyway, but that doesn’t mean they’re successful. And I mention often times people who buy those cars can’t actually afford them, as they’re on ridiculous loans or get them repossessed. 

My brother disagrees profusely and continues to debate with me about this. This debate (more of a conversation actually for the most part as it was just calm back and forth of our own personal opinions, and not trying to disprove each other’s opinion) goes on for 20 mins with a couple other people chiming in, but for the most part just being between him and I. 

I realize it’s going on too long and starting to make other people feel uncomfortable as my brother is now starting to get mad so I just say “agree to disagree” and that it’s okay that some people have different definitions of what being able to afford something means. 

He doesn’t accept this at all and continues to argue that my point is stupid and illogical. And that there can only be one definition of affording something. I refuse to talk any further and he starts to get more mad. He then starts making it personal by making comments about my lifestyle and how I have a “poor mentality” and that I will never get far with that. He starts to criticize my personal purchases and talk about how his purchases and lifestyle is more successful than mine. 

I continue to ignore him, until he mentions “you keep that poor ass mentality and when you finally save up and can only buy a little $20k car, you’ll see it’s a poor, broke ass mentality.”

I then call him a horrible person for being immature and for making a simple debate turn into him belittling me and attacking me personally. I also say that everyone in the family knows he’s a horrible person but no one ever wants to call him out for it. 
It starts to get awkward so shortly after, everybody decides its time to leave and we all end up going home.

No problem.

I have a friend who is between permanent residences right now and stays with me a lot. He was doing a load of our combined laundry, and when he went to remove it from the washing machine at about 12:45 AM, someone else's stuff was in the dryer though the cycle was complete. He took the stuff out, put ours in, started up the dryer. Same old same old.

5-10 minutes later (while I wasn't dressed and was in the bathroom), a loud knock came from the back door. I certainly was in no position to answer. A few seconds later, another, more aggressive knock.

My friend threw on a shirt and shorts and opened the door. An apparently angry neighbor who has lived there for a few months said that since the load of laundry he took out was still a bit damp, she should have had dibs on the machine to use it again before we did.

I disagree. The only time the laundry is still damp after the 1 hour dry cycle is if it was overloaded or consisted of something very heavy like towels. (Friend confirmed it was overloaded.) You pay $1 to wash, takes about 30 min, and $1 to dry, takes about an hour.

Blames people for stealing things she owned 50yrs ago. Calls in the middle of night looking for her daughter because she has to prepare her for school (obviously meaning mom and forgetting she's already an adult). Calls relatives to tell them she hasn't seen mom in months. Loses money so my mom covers most of her bills. She's aggressive when mom cleans there and she basically abuses her cats (forgets to feed them or doesn't hesitate to kick them when they get under her feet).

Now, my mom is loosing touch (nerves in hands don't work properly due to overworking herself for years, it's either operations or losing her touch completely). No driving to grandma's for a year. Her life seems over, taking care of two people who are going through life with ""I'm just waiting to die and I don't give a fuck anymore."" ideology.

So I made her do the first step and got grandma to the doctor. She has mixed dementia and Alzheimers. After that, we made calls to the appropriate facilities, the best ones we could find. Expensive, as luxurious as this goes, but it's still a one way ticket. If she'll go there, she'll never return home, we won't see her so often due to the distance and doctor believes it won't take long when you take old person from their environment... 

Grandma said she'll never forgive mom and will hate her forever... She obviously just wants her house and is an ungrateful bitch. 

(She forgot she said that next day.) 

Mom thinks she's an asshole and cries day and night because she's sending her mother somewhere against her will to basically die. 

Is she?

...

TL;DR: Mom sacrificied her health and ten years of her life to grandma's wish to live alone in a huge house. Now grandma became danger to herself and others - she has Alzheimers and mixed dementia - but keeps saying she won't forgive mom if she moves her against her will.

dlsxum,1571798354,WIBTA if I tell my group mate to fuck off?,"This happened today in French class (Canada). We  were doing a play in French play and my group was presenting. We had 8 characters and 7 people so I decided to play 2 parts as my part was relatively easy.  I shall call them by the name of the character they played (all male, but there are female parts).

So one of the characters Charles needed to somehow leave the room because of a mistake in the script (written by the teacher so everyone has to present the same thing). One part had to do with snakes so I came up with Charles fainting and Jean Marc (me) who leaves the room at the same time drags him out. They all agreed and the play was going well.

Until Charles messed up his part and I managed to make it work even though it was obvious Charles messed up. Now the only way to fix Charles's mistake was quite funny and when I was improvising so it doesn't look like a huge mess up I let out a chuckle. Pierre got super pissed at the chuckle and kicked me under the table.

I had to continue the play as I was playing 2 parts so I ignored it and went on with the play. After the play we returned to our seats and Pierre, who sits in front of me starts berating me (quietly) about ""fucking up the play"" and ""ruining his mark"". I reminded him the Charles had messed up and I was fixed Charles's mistake so he should be grateful.

He was pissed and Louis who sat next to me started talking about how I also ruined his drama mark by laughing, but the laufhing was caused by Marie by laughing. Marie also sat next to me and explained that it was his fault and not mine. I claimed that I had fault in both situations but was not only person at fault. Now keep in mind thar Charles sat near us and Pierre was only complaining about me. 

I reminded him that it was not a group mark so he started talking about ""how relieved"" he is. He also claimed he ""knew I was gonna get a bad mark."" Right now Pierre is non stop berating me on Discord about it and even had the nerve to post a highly exaggerated version of the story where I was laughing like a maniac and that Charles's mistake was all MY fault. The other people weren't in this story as they didn't really care or were neutral. I am seriously considering telling Pierre to fuck off.

I’m really desperate for extra money and I knew that if I disclosed that I would be leaving by August 6 that my chances of being hired would be zero to none.

The reason I didn’t disclose this information was because the last job interview I had (nanny), the lady had hired me knowing I would be leaving in August and then days before I started, she texted me saying she found someone else long term. Fearing this would happen again, I refrained from telling the manager I would be leaving by August. 

I told a few people that I didn’t tell the manager that I would be leaving and they’re just like, “why didn’t you tell them??”.

My roommate at the time, who was not with me, let me know that our mutual friend was coming over and hanging at our place. I was totally ok with this and said have fun. After a few hours, I came home and heard them drunkenly talking. I went into our shared bedroom (we shared a one bedroom since we were in college and couldn’t afford much more) and saw that my roommate was laying on his bed and our mutual friend was laying in my bed, with his clothes and shoes on. I am pretty anxious and am very specific about people not sitting or laying in my bed, so I became enraged and told him to get out and that because his “outside clothes” and shoes were in my bed so he had to wash the sheets. He got pretty mad, but reluctantly agreed. Where the main point of disagreement cane in here. We did not have an in-house washer and dryer so he had to pay for the laundry to be done.

After we return home, we are going camping nearby for a couple days. 

My family consists of me, my 18 YO son, 11 YO daughter, and my husband (her dad, his step dad). We also have a dog who will need to be looked after overnight. (Everyone, including Dog, will be going camping after.)

I'm not even a baseball fan. My daughter wants to go, mostly because she has never been. We got the tickets for free, and originally it was just going to be us two, until my husband said he might like to go too. My son expressed zero interest in the ball game but some interest in tagging along to do the other stuff. I asked my son if he'd mind staying to look after the dog, or if he'd rather come with us and just wait at the AirBnb during the game. He never gave me a definitive answer either way, but seemed like he might be vaguely sad about being left behind. 

I asked my husband if maybe his dad would watch our dog overnight in case Son wanted to go. He asked, his dad said ""sure"", I thought, ""great!""

This morning, however, I brought it up to my husband and he seemed irritated that (step)Son might come with us. Not that he'd have to ask a favor of his dad or that it might be inconvenient, just put out that Son would be there at all. 

I cried about it because it felt like he was deliberately excluding my son, like he thought that having him along would ruin the trip. I've been thinking about it and I still don't know if my perception of his intent was right or not. 

I think my son should be allowed to come if he wants to come, or stay if he wants to stay. But I'm just a mom, not a step-parent; I don't know how it is.  I would have more fun, not less, if everyone was where they wanted to be, doing what they wanted to be doing.

My partner told her that we were looking for a lawyer to help with our shareholder agreement so she offered to set up a consultation at her law firm to talk about it. 

When we showed up for the consultation at the law office, she had arranged for one of the managing partners to meet with us along with her. He spent about 30 minutes to an hour talking with us about what we were looking for, and my partner’s friend simply sat there not saying anything and taking notes during the meeting (she is a junior associate). The managing partner gave us some pretty useful information / important considerations for drafting our agreement. After a while, he asked what our budget was to get this done, we told him $5,000 at most (as we had received quotes at or below this price from other lawyers), and he told us it would take at least $15,000 to do it properly. I politely said we will consider it and we left the office. 

My partner’s friend followed up with me a few days later, and I told her we can’t go with her firm as we are a startup and it is way out of our price range. What I recurved in response was a very angry multi-page e-mail about how I took advantage of her generosity and how we went way out of her way and put herself on the line to get the managing partner to meet with us.

I’d like to thank everyone for your judgements, they’ve cleared some things up and I’m seriously reevaluating my family relationships. ALSO thank you so so so much for the birthday wishes! They mean so much to me! <3

I’m turning 18 on April 1st, but I’m having my party on March 30th. I planned my birthday party three weeks ago, so lots of people had time to work their schedules around it. I planned a nice dinner and invited my entire family and everyone said they would come. Then suddenly, a week before my birthday, my aunt and my uncle planned their kid’s party on the exact same day as mine, despite their kid’s birthday being on the 23rd of March. All my but 3 of my family members have cancelled coming to my party to go to my little cousin’s. Everyone is saying I should just go to my cousin’s party and basically share a birthday party with her. 

No offence to this baby, but I wasn’t really wanting to share my 18th with a 1 year old. Yesterday my mom messaged the family group chat saying that she was upset for everyone assuming I should share a birthday party with my cousin. My aunt’s family told my mom and I that we’re being “ignorant and childish”. They also told me to go cry somewhere else. I then defended my mom and myself by saying that I was only upset that everyone cancelled on me, and that I’d still come to their party. I also told them not to insult my mom for defending me. I then left the group chat because I didn’t want to fight with my uncle. My aunt and my uncle think I’m trying to ruin their little girl’s special day.

b5jxb0,1553566155,AITA for telling her fiancee that she is cheating with me,"I was in a relationship with this girl for more than a year now and two weeks ago I found out that she was cheating on me. As it turns out, she was actually cheating on him with me. Ours was a monogamous relationship because she wanted it to be. She told me one day we could get married and start family.

She was sleeping with both of us during the whole relationship. Also, I found out that she was also getting intimate with a co-worker in addition to everything.

Because I did not want her fiancee(4 years since engagement) to be in the dark, I told him everything. Fiance and her family know each other well. Now she told me not to contact her ever again or she will call the police.

She is calling me the asshole because ""I could have ended things like mature adults and not extract revenge. I have ruined her character and reputation"".

This makes no sense to me. If she had told me that she is engaged and I decided to keep a fuck-buddy relationship, I understand the need to be discreet.

Am I the asshole for doing what I did? I was just looking out for a fellow man.

EDIT1: Excuse me, English is my third language.

>If she had told me that she is engaged and **if** I decided to keep a fuck-buddy relationship, I understand the need to be discreet.

Corrected it. What I mean is if someone still agrees to have an affair with a cheater, the need to be discreet is understandable. Personally, I would not pursue anything with someone like that.

EDIT 2:

Turns out, she told him the same story she told me. 

""I want to be with you but I did not want to hurt your feelings. I care about him too. I was so confused and did not know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I fucked up.""

I did not buy it but her fiance did . He suggested me to leave her alone as she has a lot on her plate. Then he blocked me.

I also talked to the third guy. He said he just got out a divorce and does not want to be in a relationship. She told him that she broke up with me a couple of months ago(actually happened two weeks ago). He did not admit to sleeping with her but said they hung out at his house as good friends and she cooked food for him. On pressing, he admitted to kissing her on the cheek and that's it( I don't believe that, I think he is just being discreet). I remember lately she was working 'longer hours' too.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?

EDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life.

She worked at a summer camp and and now has a job about an hour away that she starts this weekend. She has spent a lot of time hanging out with friends from her summer job. I don't mind: I work two jobs and take calsses, so I'm only home late at night or early in the morning. For the past week, however, she's started having a friend over, I'll call her Zoe.

&#x200B;

Zoe likes to drink. That's not the problem; we live in a college town, so pretty much everyone does. The issue arose a year ago when my roommate and I hosted our apartment-warming party. It was the first time I met Zoe, and she was plastered, struggling to form a sentence, and could barely stand up.

&#x200B;

The problem? She was getting out of her car to arrive at the party.

&#x200B;

My little sister died less than a year ago in a car accident. It is still a very fresh wound for me. This encounter with Zoe was less than a month after my sister's funeral. Zoe didn't know and obviously drunk driving is an unfortunately common practice where I live. Again: college town.

&#x200B;

I told her politely that I'd prefer she didn't do it, and she apologized. She did it again. This time I was feeling a little bold and told her point-blank that my little sister died in a car accident, and that I didn't want to hear anymore about her unsafe driving. She came over a third time and told me again, this time gasping and saying something along the lines of 'oh, but not like your sister'.

&#x200B;

I walked away. When she left, I politely told my roommate that this was the third time Zoe had shown up wasted and told me that she was driving drunk, and I didn't want anyone coming over if they were going to be driving unsafely.

&#x200B;

I'm not a stickler- I understand a few beers or a little wine can be held well when you drive. This girl could barely keep her balance or form a sentence and she was driving 30 minutes back home. I don't want that on me. My roommate apologized, and for a while she would either go out or just cut Zoe off if they were hanging out at the apartment.

So: last week. My roommate is having Zoe every night for drinks. The first few times I literally do not see her because I beeline to my room and fall asleep, but last night Zoe stopped me and said hi. She was wasted.

I'm worried I'm coming across as sensitive: the first anniversary of my sister's death is in a few days, and I've been irritable. Would it be too far to say I don't want Zoe around for the next few weeks, because she can't respect my request for her not to drive while plastered?

She has a concealed carry permit and regularly carries a loaded gun on her, especially when she travels. She doesn’t have a holster for it or anything, just tosses it in her purse, which seems stupid, but whatever that’s her business. So when she comes to visit we ask her to leave the gun in her car because we have two young kids (an infant and a toddler). Well one day she shows up with a purse that has a pocket with a gun holster in it that zips up and then can be locked. I’m like, “That’s nice, you still have to leave your gun in the car when you visit.” Well one day she asks me to put something in her purse and when I do I see the gun sitting in the pocket, which is unzipped. Mind you the gun is loaded and my two year old who loves getting into anything and everything is running around. So I flipped out on her. Basically about how we’ve discussed this multiple times, she doesn’t take gun safety seriously, and from now on we’re searching her purse before she enters the house and the gun either needs to immediately go in our locked gun safe or in her car when she arrives. She acted like a scolded teenager who doesn’t understand why what they did was wrong, like I’m totally overreacting. Honestly, I want to tell her she cannot come visit unless she leaves the gun at home, but I know that will really upset her. We support responsible gun ownership in our family but I just feel like my mom isn’t being safe and is putting my kids at risk.

I have a longtime internet friend visiting, and my family and I are hosting her while she's in the state. 

I told my friend she could sleep in my bed- My bed is a full sized bed, and I have slept in this bed with other people without a problem. I didn't think it'd be a problem this time.

However, when it gets time to sleep, she fell asleep first. She started snoring- Okay, I can probably fall asleep despite that. A few minutes later, she moved her body so that she took up 80% of the bed. I was pushed to the edge with little room- I was still touching her even if I lied on my side. I could NOT sleep like that. My choices ended up being that I sleep in the guest room or she sleeps in the guest room.

After consulting another friend, I gently woke my friend up and simply told her I was moving her to the guest room. She complied, and I moved her downstairs to the guest bedroom.

What is tearing me up is that I could've just moved myself instead of waking her up and going back on my word. Admittedly, I felt more comfortable in my bed as it is soft and it is in my room, but I don't know if that's a valid reason.

Relevant people are below (not real names):

Sarah - my wife 

Jane - Sarah’s sister. They are very close, and I am also very close to Jane and love her like family

David – my cousin. We’re very close and Sarah loves him like family too, but honestly Sarah is closer to Jane than I am to David

Story time: Jane and David have birthdays in the same week and both are planning big birthdays (40th and 30th respectively) on the same weekend. We can’t split our time between them because they both want to go abroad to different places. In case it is a factor either way, in my family (including cousins) it is pretty normal for us to celebrate big milestone birthdays this way, whereas for Sarah’s family this weekend away would be a happy exception as they usually have more low-key celebrations. 

For various reasons (kids, other commitments etc) neither Jane or David can change the dates. I suggested that Sarah and I separate for the weekend so she goes to Jane’s 40th and I go to David’s 30th. We disagreed very strongly on this. 

Sarah’s view is we should both go to Jane’s birthday because she is closer to Jane than I am to David, and I am closer to Jane than Sarah is to David. My view is though I love Jane, I don’t want to miss David’s 30th because we have been close our whole lives.

Backstory bullet points:
I go to a book club monthly, but I’ve missed the last few months due to illness and I missed June because my husband asked me to (and I willingly did). He asked because it was the first swim meet he had been to and felt overwhelmed. 

We have 4 kids, the oldest of whom are on the swim team.  Tonight was the last night of swim meet before champs (which is during the day and my husband won’t be there so I’m not including that). 

As for tonight: I texted my husband a couple of days ago about bookclub and could we arrange for a way for me to go in spite of the meet. He didn’t respond and didn’t say anything else about it.  I sort of forgot in the midst of a busy schedule on both our parts (daily swim practice, work, home maintenance, etc).  So cue earlier today when I texted him “what time will you be here [at the meet].  I need to leave by 6:45 for my book club.” He responded “who is taking care of the girls”.  Our two youngest are 6&2.  I said I figured since it was one night he could take care of all 4 kids especially since we weren’t signed up for any volunteer positions (so that means just sitting around until the boys events are called).  Our 6 year old just runs off with her friends for the evening so she isn’t an issue at all.  My assertion was I haven’t been to my one thing that I enjoy doing kid-free in months.  And that I don’t ask him to change plans with church men’s group to accommodate my scheduled (even if it interferes with work...I get a babysitter). 

The argument - how can he take care of 4 kids at the swim meet? (My response , I’ve done it before and had a job there). He was concerned about them being out late (I figured it’s only one night it won’t hurt anyone).  Then he said, “what if she (the 2 year old) has a blow out and I don’t have anywhere to wash my hands?”  

At that point I just said, “I’m going.  If that’s the only reason I can’t go is for that - I’m not cancelling.”  At which point he said “fine go then”.

In return I've helped him through his mothers death, gave him leads to land a great job, and have taken care of his pets after he couldn't keep them anymore. All this to say, we're very close.

For the past year, maybe a bit longer, he has been dating a woman whose now pregnant. He plans on marrying her, he loves her, and he's excited to be a father and start a family, which is his dream. I am happy to see him happy.

However, I now know that his girlfriend and future wife cheated on him, as far back as four or five months ago. I know this because another mutual friend of ours confessed to me that he had sex with her, multiple times, and he feels guilty because now their relationship is getting even more serious. 

He also thinks that the baby may not be my best friends, because the girlfriend apparently had relations with other guys after their affair was over. 

Here's the kicker. The cheater friend who told me this swore me to secrecy, and showed me texts where the girlfriend told him she is faithful to my best friend now, and that she's trying to move forward into a new life. She says that the baby is my best friends, and asked the cheater to please stay quiet (which he didnt as he told me).

Now that I know all this, I made the choice to not tell my best friend, and to let him marry this girl and raise the kid as his child, and try to be happy. I don't want to see his world shatter.

I told my sister my decision, and she was frankly disgusted that I wouldn't tell someone who has done so much for me.

There’s also an option where you set a dollar amount and if you break your time limit, that dollar amount is deducted from your bank account and used to plant real trees. Well I also use this app to help me procrastinate less while I study and so I figured I would make the dollar amount $1,000 so that I would NEVER touch my phone or else I’d lose all that money (broke student).

ayblnf,1551957896,AITA for cutting contact with my friend after he came out of the closet?,"The title makes it sound worse than it is.

This takes place about 5 years ago. Some friends were talking about this guy recently and it got me thinking about this.

I had a friend, been friends with him for the best part of a decade, probably about 7/8 years.

I’ll start by saying, I knew he was gay, he confided in me, but he was really nervous about coming out publicly and generally. So I kept it to myself.

I have absolutely no problem with people of whatever orientation, so long as you respect my decision if I turn you down I don’t give a shit what consenting adults do with one another.

So my friend tells me he is going to take the plunge and come out publicly. It goes about how I expected it to, his parents were like “We knew that” his other close friends were like “Took you long enough!” And so on.

This is the part where it takes a turn I didn’t expect. Previously, he was a guy who you could hold a conversation with, debate with, disagree with, play video games, have a beer with whatever. A couple of months go by and he becomes a totally different person.

He starts dressing more and more flamboyantly (who cares) he starts putting on “the voice” I don’t wanna start throwing stereotypes around but I’m sure you know what I mean (I still don’t care) but what really got my goat, was that he started using his sexuality as the basis for *everything* and he suddenly started trying to “one-up” everything that was discussed with him.

For example, we were discussing same marriage, which wasn’t legal at the time, I was all for it, I think people should be with who they loved regardless of genders or whatever. He would bizarrely, argue against my point of view. 

“You don’t know what you’re talking about, you couldn’t understand the necessity for same sex marriage **as a gay** I have a much better grasp of the issue”

Right okay, if you say so.

It just got more and more ridiculous after that.

“Ha, they spelt my name wrong at Starbucks”

“They spell mine wrong every time I visit **because I’m gay**”

“Some dick scratched my car!”

“Someone slashed my tires **because I’m gay**”

“Didn’t you get a flat because of some debris in the road? I’m fairly sure I helped you swap that tire?”

“No, it was an attack against me because of my sexuality”

It repeats like this until, honestly, it felt like a chore talking to him. Everything and anything was always worse for him because he was gay.

Eventually I just stopped hanging out with him, he moved away shortly after that to the city and I haven’t spoken to him since.

I feel like I’d have stopped speaking to anyone who constantly had to go one better regardless of what i said, but at the same time was a bit of a dick for not giving him longer to settle into his new life/personality/whatever after coming out?

We are close friends with another couple that have two kids, ages almost 4 and almost 1. I've known him since high school and her just the 6 years they have been together.

About once a month, this couple asks us to watch one or both of their kids so that they can go out or because they have some other social commitment. Generally we don't mind, but I think I've reached my breaking point. The nights that they ask us to watch the kids are weeknights and usually for about 5 hours each time. Their kids do not go to bed early, so my wife and I are putting them down around 9:30-10pm, which means we don't get back home until after 10. Also, very rarely does this other couple provide dinner for us. We have to come up with something after we get there and realize, yet again, we have to order something and pay for it ourselves. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking to get paid - though baby sitters in our area make about $15/hour. But I would expect that they leave us some money to order a pizza or something. I honestly don't know if this couple has ever had to pay for a baby sitter since they seem to use us or family in the area.

My wife and I don't have kids yet, but we are expecting our first in November of this year. My wife watched one of the kids last night and didn't get home until almost 11. Being nearly 4.5 months pregnant, she doesn't always feel the best and is generally uncomfortable and tired a lot.

This weekend was one of my best friends birthdays, and we are both really close with her so obviously we both went to her little birthday party at her house. At the end of the night, i was busy helping the birthday girl throw up and getting her into bed (classic college moment) and my roommate comes in and is asking “do you know where my wax pen is i can’t find it” and so i helped her look for a little while but i hadn’t seen it since the beginning of the night. No biggie right I’m sure we would find it the next day. The next day comes though and we didn’t find it and now my roommate is telling me that she think i should replace it because i lost it? I haven’t even responded to her bc it really rubbed me the wrong way but am i mistaken in thinking it’s ridiculous to ask me to replace something i had nothing to do with losing? And if you’re at a party it is nobodys fault but your own if you lose one of your possessions. And if it were something that was actually really expensive like a phone or something then i could almost rationalize where she’s coming from but like this is a maybe $40 pen battery and if she can brag about how much money she’s always making then why can’t she just replace it herself.

However, after my friends and I finish eating, I hear them calling my name again. The place was now empty and I went up, the worker said, spicy chicken on a donut with fries? They definitely made my order twice and I accepted both of them.

cfxu9q,1563706785,AITA for telling my mom that I'll help her later?,"Last night I was chatting on the phone with my boyfriend while drawing. My mom came to me asking to use the laptop (her laptop is busted so she uses mine) so I gave her and continued talking. She started back college and had an assignment to do. I helped her yesterday with showing her how to use the shapes on Google docs to make a flow chart, however, she's telling me that her group member told her that there were changes to be made so I said ""...alright."" and continued with my phone conversation.

She then asks me to help her again, but 'when I'm finished talking on the phone.' I told her ""sure but it won't be until later because I'm on the phone right now."" And she says okay okay and just stares at the computer. I then told her ""but, I showed you what to do yesterday, can't you just do that now?"" Then she tells me she wasn't paying attention ._.

I got a little upset and kind of raised my voice because I'm trying to relax but I gotta stop and put down everything I'm doing to do her work for her. So I told her I'll help her later. She got upset with me and went on a tangent about me helping everyone else and I don't like to help her at all with anything and that I'm always helping out people. Then she was upset that I was on the still telling her 'I'll do it laterr' and she found it to be disrespectful how I used my tone. And after that, she just didn't talk to me for the rest of the night into this morning.

b5omiz,1553600357,AITA for saying it would have been better if you let me know earlier for my bro's wedding?,"So my little brother calls me 6 days before his wedding just to ""tell"" me about him having a wedding. He doesn't ask if I want to go, no invitation, nothing of the sort.

He says, ""Hey I'm getting married next Sunday and I just want to give you the heads up""! I promptly congratulate him and because it was a last minute notice, I assume that it's a simple courthouse marriage. However, I was startled when he says he's having a wedding... WTF right?

&#x200B;

To add to that, he tells me it's on a whim because he's shipping out for the Air Force in 8 days and wants to get married right before going. He is doing it for the benefits as you get more going in married so I can understand all that.

He also adds that the bride's family wants something big for their daughter so that is why they are having a wedding. Again, I can understand the thing with the bride and her family, but why tell me just 6 days prior to? Is it actually possible to prepare a wedding that fast?

&#x200B;

I would also like to add that I live overseas but very flexible so I can go to my brother's wedding even with the late notice, but as I continue to talk to my brother, the conversation is just chit-chat. Not once does he ask if I want to come. We chat for about an hour and the invite never came. So I got the message that I'm not invited.

&#x200B;

The next morning, my mother calls and she tells me to just go. I'm reluctant but the benefits of going totally outweigh not going. So I go online and reserve a ticket. unfortunately, as I was reserving a ticket, I realized that my passport expired. How unlucky is that with just 5 days to go before the wedding!!! I'm pissed! 

Now I'm working on trying to renew my passport but it has to be a life or death emergency to get it renewed in a day. I even contacted an old colleague who works for the State Dept. but it doesn't look promising. 

&#x200B;

As family, this whole thing with my brother telling me about the wedding last minute and not inviting me really upsets me? He and his fiance had to plan this ahead of time right? 

&#x200B;

So, for the benefit of the doubt I bit the bullet and called him back and asked him directly if he actually wants me to go and he says yes.

I tell him, ""thank you for the invite, I wish you said that last night! Btw, my passport expired but I'm working on it"". He tells me that it's fine if I can't make it because it was so last minute. I reply, "" Yes it is last minute but it would have been so much better if you let me know about your wedding much earlier.""    

I didn't expect anything after saying that but I think that was the trigger that blew him up. He was yelling so much that I could not understand most of what he was saying. From this point on, it's a one way conversation of him bringing up past drama I don't even care about.

Backstory- so this is the 4th time the dog has chewed something of mine. I try to keep my door closed but sometimes forget to. Twice he has gotten in and chewed something. Fortunately not damaging it but nonetheless very annoying. The 3rd and 4th time the dog got my purse and jacket I left on the back of a chair in the livingroom and chewed the zippers off, basically damaging both. The owner did not do anything but say to keep stuff in my room and keep it closed. All these times the owner/roommate has been home but dog is free to roam the house out of sight and then gets into stuff. 

So WIBTA if I say the dog must be in sight or on a leash in the house or caged when roommate isnt home? Until the dog is trained not to chew.  And if something is damaged it must be replaced? My roommate is a friend so I'm trying to balance this.",False,not the asshole,7,9,0
c3f41n,1561144906,AITA for not wanting to go to my girlfriend's friend's birthday bash?,"throw away account

A couple weeks ago my gf made me aware of her friend's birthday party in NYC. I live about 3 hours away, so I said sure let's go that weekend. Then things started to get a bit complicated.

Problem #1: I soon learned that this is more than a birthday party, it's a whole birthday weekend. As a matter of fact for him it's an entire birthday week; he's going to be there with some other friends a week leading up until we're supposed to arrive. He is unemployed and gets all of his money from his parents, so the trip will be fully funded for him and with all his spare time he's built a massive itinerary. I'm expected to go from Friday to Sunday, and I'm encouraged to stay until Monday. I work week days, so I'm simply not staying later than Sunday. In fact I would prefer to just go on Saturday, not stay overnight at all and save myself hundreds on a hotel room for the party of someone I hardly know. This way I can celebrate his birthday on his actual birthday, nice and simple, and not have to abide by the strict and unaccommodating itinerary (i'll get to this next) the rest of the weekend.

Problem #2: the itinerary was very clearly not built to suit anyone but him. I just got the itinerary sent to me yesterday and I'm floored. This guy is gay, which is obviously fine and I have no problems with him personally, but the weekend consists mostly of Pride events, and not the type I'm excited to go to. I would be fine with going to a Pride march or something like that to support my gf who's supporting her friend, but it's not that lowkey. On Saturday night I'm expected to attend ""World Pride Erotika,"" with a $30 entry fee, from 11 PM to 4 AM. I'm not entirely sure what that entails but I think I would rather do something else... The alternative is to hang out somewhere else in NYC and obviously get a hotel room for hundreds of dollars that night. Gf is very opposed to leaving the same day we arrive, so a hotel room seems like a certainty. On top of this the restaurants in the schedule are very high end and will cost hundreds more. Once again, the birthday boy will be paid for entirely by parents.

Maybe I'm boring but if I throw a party I provide for my guests, it will be one event somewhere local with food and drinks. Definitely wouldn't last all day. ""Thanks for coming and have a safe drive home""

This guy wants me to drive 3 hours each way, put up what I'm guessing will come out to be somewhere between $500 and $1000, and attend all of his Pride events on his schedule. I think that's asking too much. By a mile and a half.

cde28h,1563173083,AITA for not wanting my girlfriend or I to go to her friends wedding?,"My old post titled was “AITA for refusing to let my girlfriend go to her friends wedding?”

I really regret using those poor choice of words, I got bashed for it but it’s all well deserved as I have no right to “refuse” or “let” my girlfriend do anything she doesn’t want to. I was rushing to write this as I was desperate for advice as this ordeal just happened an hour ago, just got home and immediately rushed to Reddit to get advice. 

Additionally, I didn’t think I would get so many responses so I didn’t explain everything, my old post lacked important information that got asked a lot in the comments so I’ll be more thorough this time around.

My [18] girlfriend has a [18] friend from back where she was born in Seoul, Korea. She had just came to visit for the summer break as we had all just graduated high school. They hung out for a couple days and when my girlfriend got back she told me about how her friends getting married! I was pretty surprised as we’re young but whatever I thought.

We talked more and she revealed he’s 42 years old! I was absolutely disgusted I’m not gonna lie, and it shown on my face as she told the story. I could tell my girlfriend was getting annoyed but she continued, explaining how he had 2 failed marriages in the past and 4 kids, one being the same age as her! I couldn’t believe it and asked how long they’ve been together to which she said TWO YEARS. 

We live in the US, so in my opinion that’s super illegal as well since he was with her when she was 16, a minor in the US. I showed my obvious disinterest and even called him a bad name. She got really mad and said that’s rude to her friend. I told her I don’t think we should go because it’s morally wrong, I think it’s a whole different story if she met him at 18 and got married fast, whatever that’s a bad choice but fine. But the fact that she was a young girl when this old ass man began having a relationship with her is mind boggling. 

We argued a lot and she’s very upset, she’s thinking about if she wants to go but she tried coming back asking to go again to just show support for her friend and her friend alone, I told her marriage is about supporting the act of them being together I would have to watch them the entire time as the event is about the two of them. She said we’d talk tomorrow and went to bed.

During that time, he stayed with, my mom and my younger sister during the last summer.

At first i thought i could handle it, a bit of snoring, nothing to big. But then i remembered that my uncle talks in sleep. Like an actual conversation. He talks loudly, threatning someone to punch them (i don't know), and, in a more recent cases, laughing.

I have Tourette Syndrome, but my tics are relatively subtle. It’s mostly facial and neck tics for motor tics and humming and tongue clicks for vocal ones.

It’s entirely possible for me to suppress tics, but it’s kinda like suppressing a cough or sneeze in that it’s pretty unpleasant. If I suppress them for too long, I’ll have an episode of intense ticcing including hand and less subtle vocal tics.

People have expressed annoyance at me on several occasions about humming and clicking my tongue in class. While I could stop in theory, suppressing it for two hours straight would be extremely difficult and lead to worse situations after class.

My perspective is that it’s not realistic for me to put myself through that every day, but I also understand that my classmates all payed for the classes.

I find it very difficult to purchase gifts for them but they find it quite easy to find them for me. Last year, I didn't get my brother a gift, just a card that I wrote in with a nice message, and my mom/dad/brother still bring it up as the year I didn't get him anything, which they say was rude, because he has always gotten me something nice.During random dinner's my brother will say something like ""If I remember correctly, you didn't give me a gift last year"". I said I really couldn't afford it that year and that I picked and wrote a card instead.

Everyone jokes around about ""how long til y'all are married yet?"" 

So she has this friend she had grown up with til she was around 10 give or take a year or two and had been pretty close with him on and off as a family friend we will call him J. Well, I already had some suspicion about this summer such as her suddenly being busy when I was supposed to come visit or her suddenly going out of town. She had told me a few times she was planning on going and visiting a friend she had made in her sorority like group who we will call E which she actually did so my suspicion lessened over a month or so and everything seemed very normal and happy. I spent this past weekend helping her move across town closer to her University and spent a good majority of two days doing so. 

So the reason I made this post is I had to help set up her WiFi at her new place and it required having the Mac address of each device added. No big deal. Well when she let me add her phone I couldn't help but notice she had fucking tinder downloaded dead center of a bunch of other apps on her phone. So it was very obvious she wasn't trying to hide anything. And since that rose my suspicion higher than it's ever been, she had left her phone in the bathroom when I went to take a shower this morning and we are very open and neither one of us get mad if the other needs to use the others phone for texting and calling people. So I locked the door and went through her texts and found that not only had she been texting her friend J for around 5 months as far as I could tell.

It basically said how I would NOT be moving to the city I’m looking at because it’s a thinly veiled attempt to be close to someone I was with and their family, that it makes me look desperate and pathetic. That I would be dropping my promise to a school I voluntarily work for, and that people wouldn’t count on me. They said Im not respectful, I’m not appreciative, to plaster a smile on my face, and say thank you. They also said that I need to grow up, be an adult, not make decisions based off of emotions, and that they were embarrassed by my quitting attitude. 
.
I’ve tried telling them my whole plan, and how I’m going to get there with each step of the way. I did the best I possibly could to make it as much of an adult conversation as I could. I’m 19 and I believe that I should be able to make adult decisions with my own money, time, and effort.

d8jjpp,1569308347,AITA to end a friendship with a friend because her mom did not want my boyfriend staying over?,"Firstly this happened when I was in university, and it’s been years since then. My friendship with my housemate never recovered from this, and we haven’t spoken since then due to this and other several other smaller reasons. Putting this out there now because a. I want to know if I was the asshole in the situation and b. because it’s an entertaining story.

&#x200B;

Anna and I met when we were in college together. We were extremely close as we were each other’s family away from home. Once we had graduated from college and our student hostel, we found a new apartment to live in together during our uni studies.

&#x200B;

When we moved in together, Anna and I were single. Towards the end of the first year of uni, I got into a relationship with Edward. I asked Anna if it was all right if Edward stayed over on some weekends, because I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. Anna’s family are Christians and obviously did not approve of premarital sex. Anna herself had no issues with premarital sex.

&#x200B;

Anna said it was fine.

&#x200B;

During our second year of uni, Anna’s sister Felicity moved into our apartment. Anna and Felicity shared one room. The rent was still split 50/50 (half for the 2 of them, half for me).

&#x200B;

One day, Anna and Felicity’s family decided to visit. We all come from other countries, so her parents had to fly in. When Anna’s mom found out my boyfriend had been sleeping over, she raged and said it was unacceptable. From now on, my boyfriend would not be able to sleep over. Anna KNEW she told me it was fine in the previous year, and she freaked out. She is extremely passive aggressive, and tells Felicity to tell me instead.

&#x200B;

I was confused, because this was not what Anna and I agreed on, and I told Felicity. I said I was not going to ask my boyfriend to stop sleeping over because I can’t sleep over at his place for many reasons.

&#x200B;

Not allowing my bf to sleep over was a dealbreaker for me, and I wouldn't have agreed to share an apartment with Anna if this was agreed on upfront. I also told Felicity that I was paying the bulk of the rent, so I should have more say. I ended it by saying if her mother/parents could not accept this, I would move out.

&#x200B;

Throughout all this, Anna was avoiding me so I had to do all this talking with her younger sister. I was livid.

&#x200B;

They obviously did not want to pay for the entire apartment, so we reached an impasse. I disregarded whatever the mom said, and continued to have my boyfriend stay over even while the mom was still visiting (the parents never stayed over at our apartment because there was no space, but they were there in the day to cook etc). Felicity tweeted passive aggressive stuff about me and him in my room, but I just laughed it off. Anna never addressed this issue about her mom with me.

&#x200B;

Our leases ended at the end of the year, and I moved out. We stopped being friends then, and we never reconnected until today.

bfvow8,1555892901,WIBTA If I said to my friend that she can't bring her boyfriend to sleep in my house?,"I'm an 28yo female and I really love to live alone. It's not that I don't like to be around other people, which I do, but I have this job that implies that I'm making contact with people 8h/day, and when I get home I just want to be alone in my own space.

This is the story: 3 months ago my friend (28F) had to move temporarily (7 months) to my city for work. Since she knew I had a spare room in my apartment, she asked if she could stay there during that 7 month period. I have to tell you, I really didn't want to do that because, like I said before, I like to have my own space and even little noises or little changes in the things I've around my home bother me (I know, maybe you are thinking that I freak out upon futile domestic things but I have to remind you at this point that I chose to live alone for these reasons, so as to not bother anyone with my pickiness!). However, since the rental cost in my city is too high and my friend had to keep paying the rent at her former city, I couldn't say no to my friend in this situation. So she started to live with me and until now it has not been very bad: she talks a lot and loud, I wake up every morning before I have to because she simply can't close the doors/drawers/whatever in a silent way and she's always on my beautiful and cosy couch when I need it the most. But I know it'll be this way because I know her for a long time.

The thing that is crossing my limits it's this: one month ago she started dating this guy and looks like they are an official couple now. She asked me back then if she could bring him home one night and I said yes (God knows how much it cost me!). Now, every week she asks me if she can stay at my house for several days in a row... and now I have to wake up to loud sex in the room next to mine. Besides, there are days that she leaves her boyfriend in her bedroom to go to work and the poor soul stays there for hours until she cames back. I really don't feel comfortable with this at all. I mean, he looks like a nice guy, but... IT'S MY HOUSE! I didn't even want that my friend lived there and now I have to live with a stranger too?!

AIBTA for thinking that she's going over the line with this: I know that she is asking me every time if he can stay there, but I wouldn't even dare to ask that kind of thing to a friend - like, me asking my friend to do me the favour of letting me live in her apartment for 7 months for free and then asking her to live also with my boyfriend? Not in a million years!

9cmjkt,1535989806,AITA for asking my boyfriend to help pay for gas?,"My boyfriend and I met at the end of last year. I have a car. He does not. He started driving my car around January. It was sometimes convenient for us for him to take the car between my place and his while I took the bus to school (no parking on campus). 

Eventually he started using the car for his own purposes without me, like picking up all of his friends to come to his place and drink. I was slightly uncomfortable but didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to start a fight. His face showed me he knew I’d have a problem with it but “it’s better to ask forgiveness than permission.” 

Over the summer I had work and he did not. He often stayed at my place, drove me to work and went home to his own apartment in my car and then picked me back up at work. It was lovely to be picked up and dropped off at work instead of taking the bus. Without him, I would’ve had to take the bus due to the parking situation. Many times throughout the summer I asked him to take care of chores or emergencies for me while I was at work, because he had my car.

Also over the summer, we started splitting gas. He was using the car as often as I, and splitting it was his idea. 

We eventually found out he’d be moving far away for work. There was a month gap between when his lease ended and his work began. So he moved in with me. I asked him to split utilities. He did. We shared the car equally and he continued to split gas. We split groceries. We split entertainment bills. He had brought up splitting rent several months ago because we had thought he would move in with me long term. He didn’t bring up rent after moving in. And neither did I - I knew he could’ve stayed with a friend instead of me, for free. 

Boyfriend moved out on Saturday. I drove him to the airport. But on Friday I filled the tank, and asked him to split it. He said no. He said the tank of gas would be for gas moving forward and he wouldn’t be around to use it. So he didn’t want to split the tank with me. I pushed back and said we’d been driving the same car since we met. And I hadn’t asked him for gas money in the first 6 months. He paid the 9 stupid dollars. AITA?

bgvuo0,1556119039,AITA for not telling my ex manager the truth?,"This happened a while ago, but I may have been a bit of a petty asshole in this instance.

I used to work at a gas station as a cashier and stock person. The manager was a complete micromanager, and it was a regular occurrence for her to pull me into the office over the smallest things. I wasn’t a bad employee, the owner thought I was great, my coworkers loved me, and the customers thought I did a great job. The turnover rate at this place was ridiculous, and most people left because of her. 

Well one day, when I was sorting through bottle and can returns, I found a makeshift weed pipe made out of a pop bottle, and I thought it was hilarious that someone actually returned it for ten cents. I wanted to show one of my coworkers, so I hid it in the bottle room but forgot about it. 

Months later, I had quit and was much happier at a different local gas station. One of my old coworkers and close friends came to my house to hang out one day, and he told me some major drama was happening at the store. He found the makeshift pipe, thought it was hilarious as I did, and showed his new coworker. Well, she called the owner and manager, and my manager was trying to find out who it belonged to. Since it was hidden in the bottle room, they thought an employee was smoking during their shifts.

I won’t lie, I couldn’t stop laughing as I told my friend my side of the story. We both laughed and moved on. The next day we ran into the store, and the manager pulled me aside. She said she knew it wasn’t mine since I was a good kid, but she asked me if I knew anything about the bottle. I played dumb and I told her no, kind of laughing on the inside. I really didn’t feel like getting berated or accused of anything, so at the time I thought it would be better to keep to myself.

No one got fired over it, and eventually the store moved on. I was telling this story to someone, and they brought up the point that someone could have been fired, and I had the chance to prevent that. I really didn’t want to get involved in all the drama, and I don’t think she would have bought the story of me finding it in the returns.

cp8pas,1565592437,AITA for not working while married?,"My husband and I moved to a smaller town for his new job offer. It had been 1.5 years of me barely working and losing 5 jobs due to major medical stuff. Before moving I had one rule which was that we would find our own place first where we can have our cats. We arrived at the start of March. Moved in with my father in law. My father in law lives 20 minutes outside of town in the middle of nowhere and I don't drive. I made it clear I couldn't work because of this. I was assured it would only be 2 months. I tried to find a job for a month but no luck and we agreed to wait until we have a place of our own.

Fast forward to the start of June,  my husband is upset because A) I don't drive and B) I am not working. 

I am terrified of driving butt I agreed to try and get my license since he emphasized that he just wanted to see me putting in an effort.

As for work we went over the logistics again and agreed it wouldn't work and he assured me the drivers license would be enough.

Now it is august and he is angry again about the lack of work. I've been actively studying for a driver's license I don't even want to keep him happy and benifit our future, but now it isn't enough. He has come at me aggressively twice about this this week.

Tonight he tells me he needed to talk to me directly about it, instead of 'complaining about me a lot to random people'.

I get how being the only one making money is hard but we literally don't pay rent. He is making more money. We haven't found a place of our own to live and I don't complain despite it being an agreement upon the move. We have agreed several times that me getting to work is challanging and costly. He stated very clearly that working towards my drivers license would be enough. And yet somehow he sees me as still not putting in enough effort.

I agreed to apply for jobs but honestly I am pissed. Not only do I feel like he sees anything I try to do as not good enough, but he told me he is complaining about me to random people in a small town. 

I'm insulted and disgusted and I don't think I'm being unreasonable, especially since I couldn't find work in that first month. I'm not against working  but I don't see the point in it if I can't even get to the job and I mentally cannot handle losing another job.

ci3ssz,1564152585,WIBTA if I told a religious co-worker to stop blessing me and encouraging me to accept Jesus?,"The background is we've worked with each other for a couple years. We have a perfectly find work relationship and are very nice to one another. At work religion and politics almost never comes up. However, with pro life bills gaining popularity there was a bit of an impromptu victory celebration between her and another female co-worker. I felt this was in very poor taste being at work and all. Truth be told believe what you want for religion and politics both, but I think there's a time and place for certain things. 

I am personally not religious and a Democrat. Because we are friendly I let her know that I saw/overheard the celebration which she did not initiate herself to let her know that stuff is best left for off work hours. Our subsequent conversation turned towards views of pro life and pro choice. As a man who could never fully appreciate the enormous gravity of a situation where one mightchoose abortion I  very much pro choice and let it be known that religion has nothing to do with it. The woman asked that I consider letting Jesus into my heart. She does not say these things too often. 

Just today she asks if I'll listen to a podcast episode about Christianity and it's relationship to women. I say I will because why not. She sends me the link via text but then goes into say may the ""message bless you and encourage your heart."" That kind of follow up text just ribs me the wrong way. Bottom line the takeaway of the podcast is that women should just have faith that God will enforce divine punishment on those who do evil. Even rapists. I very much disagree and know that we the living can handle these things just fine and should punish wrongdoers. That's justice. 

WIBTA if I asked her to stop blessing me?

Update: I know the post hasn't been up long. At this point I'll just share my view on the podcast I said I'd listen to and just ignore her blessings and offers of Jesus. Definitely no need for HR. But moving forward I plan on quickly moving away from religion and politics in conversation. Thanks everyone.

Update 2: we had a brief conversation about the podcast. I feel it went well, but by the end I did say that maybe our conversations should avoid talking about religion because we just don't share the same views. I felt that was best.",1564167815.0,not the asshole,129,72,0

b2ie6x,1552913702,AITA: Maid of Honour Has Ditched Me After Offering to Plan My Bachelorette Party. Am I the Asshole?,"Pretty long, so TDLR at the end.

I wasn't even planning on having a maid of honour to begin with. I asked my three closest friends to be bridesmaids, and I didn't want to choose a ""favourite."" I was thinking it would be fun to plan my hen do (bachelorette party for those in the US) together as a group. But one of the girls, my best friend from high school, said she wanted the job, so I thought ""why not?"" I was actually kind of touched that she cared enough to volunteer.

Anyway, almost immediately after offering she got a new job and a new boyfriend. She pretty much stopped responding to my messages (not even wedding-related stuff, just normal conversation), and when she did reply her responses were short and blunt. When I did mention anything wedding-related, she was snappy and even occasionally hurtful. I thought maybe she had a lot on her plate (she works in a stressful industry and this is her first real job in it) but it's been months now and things haven't got any better. 

I asked her if she was upset with me and if she still wanted to be MoH, and she seemed really offended, and just said ""why would you ask me that?"" She then showed interest for about a day before going back to being weird again. 

I asked her to save an hour or two for me this weekend where we could get some planning done (I thought if we did it together it might take some of the pressure off). She said fine. Time we set to meet rolls around and I hear nothing from her. I message asking where she is, get no reply, and after an hour of waiting give up. The next day I get a message saying ""sorry I was at my boyfriends.""

I know this all sounds petty, but the wedding is getting closer and no planning for my hen party has been done. The only thing that is sorted is the date, which I did myself. It hurts even more because our best man is making a huge effort for my fiance, where as my MoH can't even been bothered to respond to my messages. The thing is, if the situation was reversed I'd be making a huge effort for her because I care. My fiance saw how upset this is making me and asked one of the other two girls to help, but she's not really a ""planner"" and hates making decisions, so again everything has stalled. My other bridesmaid is travelling the world and won't be back until a week before the wedding. 

I feel really lonely and friendless, but I'm also not sure if I'm being a bridezilla and expecting too much. Am I the asshole?

TDLR: BFF asked to be Maid of Honour and offered to plan the hen do/bachelorette party, then ditches me with no explanation. Not sure if I have a right to be hurt or if I'm being entitled/a bridezilla. 

Update: Thanks for the advice everyone. At least I know I'm not a bridezilla! This whole thing has made me realise that our friendship has been going down hill for the last year and I just didn't want to admit it. I had a tough time at the end of last year after being made redundant from my job, and I realised she was acting like this then as well - ignoring my messages when I needed to talk or acting like I hadn't mentioned it and avoiding the topic, and to be honest I'm exhausted. If this was someone I was dating was this hot and cold I'd have told them to fuck off by now. It sucks because we've been friends for 15 years, but thanks to this thread I've realised it's best to just leave her alone in general and organise the party myself (even though that makes me feel like a bit of a loser).

Last Christmas I spent with my mom, and it was a disaster. She woke us up at around 6:30 despite us being up late, and we were complaining about getting up early as you do. Not five minutes later, my mom starts screaming at us about how we ruined her day and her plans and that were ungrateful. She said a load of shit that honestly I can’t remember, but the whole thing lasted about an hour and a half during which it reached its peak. I was crying like a baby as was my sister, and eventually she kicked my sister (17 at the time, we’ll call her Jenny) out of the house for arguing with my mom.

Jenny had to sit in our old car because it started raining outside and was texting me about being hungry (we didn’t get breakfast) and cold. I got up to get her food and my mom confronted me. I told her that my sister was cold, hungry, and crying and that I wanted to bring her food. My mom asked how I knew, and I said Jenny had been texting me.

My mom texts Jenny saying she could come inside (around 8-8:30 at this point) and my sister took some time to compose herself and my mother texted her saying “Guess you weren’t really that cold then”. We opened presents, mom acted like everything was normal. We didn’t talk about it.

I decided that I was tired of holidays with my mom.

Previous Christmas I mentioned how it didn’t feel like Christmas because it was warm, and my mom started screaming that I was ungrateful and we didn’t have a lot of money and kicked us out at night. I got sick and fell asleep before she let us back in.

My mom loves me. She’s lost one of her children and one has completely cut her off from her life. When raising her other kids, a lot of stuff happened so they didn’t get a normal upbringing, and I know she’s trying to give Jenny and I as normal of a childhood as possible.

Christmas is coming up and I’m spending it with my dad. But other holidays like Thanksgiving and New Years I’m terrified of being at my moms.

This friend used to always have arguments with me and expect me to always apologies which i always refused as i thought i wasn't the bad guy and that these arguements were stupid. Ill give you some example of these disagreements.

I made a group chat to talk about something that is coming up, i only included people who were involved in the event as i thought no one else wants to be annoyed with the messages coming in about something that didn't know. My friend OBVIOUSLY didn't like this as they then had a go at me for not including some people and that i did it on purpose.

Another one is they got annoyed and said they didn't want to be my friends anymore (which she wanted to be my friend after) because i acted differently with my lifelong friends - friends i had know my WHOLE life where as i had know them for about 2/3 years

And possibly one of the biggest arguments was when i politely declined to borrow something from her as it wouldn't be necessary. They then called me stuff like ""ungrateful"" and that i have ""no sympathy for anyone"" and sending 25ish messages saying how mad she is and how hard im making it for her

And this might have been the message she sent that really pushed me to not want to be their friend. I had messaged them just saying ""hey do you want to talk"" to which they responded basically saying that i should get off my phone and actually talk to my family for once instead of staying on my phone all day. In all caps did i mention.

yesterday, my boyfriend’s father continuously made some weird comments with racist and ignorant undertones while we were at a korean bbq place. basically acted like the food was weird or strange without trying it first. he’s said some other problematic stuff too, like when my boyfriend and i were visiting the philippines (my homeland), he said, “don’t get lost in the jungle!” and when we were in japan and mentioned being in a forested area, he made an inappropriate joke that i can’t say in this subreddit. both these comments upset me as i don’t want him making these kinds of comments around my family when they eventually meet and i also struggle with depression and just consider these comments just insensitive and ignorant overall.

he also refuses to listen to my boyfriend’s directions while driving around the city that WE live in and thinks he knows better and when my boyfriend and his mother tried to help him find a parking spot, he blew up and said, “everyone keeps telling me how to fucking drive!” and my boyfriend and his mother just laughed. apparently, they just enjoy pissing him off, but the whole interaction just made me uncomfortable.

bfcv2g,1555771194,AITA for keeping my ex roommate’s check?," So me and my best friend were roommates for 6 months. We originally agreed to split everything rent/utilities down the middle. During the 6 months we were living together my roommate didn’t help me pay any of the utilities which were in my name. He also only paid $100 towards our security deposit. There was 1 month where I paid the whole months rent as well.
  
  My roommate is also bipolar 1 which was uncontrolled at the time. We got into a huge argument and I had a mental breakdown and I ended up in the mental hospital for 5 days. While I was in the hospital my roommate told my mother he was breaking the lease and he left. Before he left he wrote his blank paycheck to me in my name and he told my mother he was leaving it to me. I still have the text messages stating so. I moved out as well thanks to my super understanding landlord. A few weeks later his mother text me asking about the check and saying that “he wasn’t in his right mind to give me the check”. He told my mother in the text messages that he intended for it to go towards what he owed me. She said that I took advantage of his mental state by accepting the check.

 This happened back in February. The check was for $200. AITA? I haven’t heard from him since he left and I suspect he was in the hospital. I only heard from his mother about the money. He’s blocked me everywhere, and I assume it’s about the money.",False,not the asshole,4,34,0
bi6qtb,1556419435,WIBTA for contacting my estranged Dad?,"Basically, yeah. 
After all of 20 years doing some digging and asking around, I finally have the identity of the man who helped make me but didn’t wanna stick around. 
I’ve never known him and he hasn’t reached out to me. 
I found him on Facebook recently and added him. He added me back instantly. 

He has two kids and is engaged according to his profile, and seems to be doing well.
I really just want to get to know him. I don’t want a relationship with him. I really just am interested in getting to know who this guy is. 
I don’t hold anything against him and know pretty much nothing else about him. 

Would I be the asshole if I sent him a message on Facebook? Just stating that I think he may be my biological father and I’m open to talking over coffee and getting to know each other. 

I really don’t know where else to turn with this, any advice would be appreciated.

EDIT: I am 100% this is the guy. My mother confirmed it for me by showing me his facebook page yesterday. We had talked about him (a very rare discussion) and since I’m an adult now, she agreed I should know more about him. 
Also, yes, he does know that I exist. He (23 at the time) got my (18 at the time) mother pregnant on accident at a party. All consensual, just totally unplanned pregnancy! She broke the news to him and he skidaddled. He lives in the same city as me now, oddly enough.

I messaged him.

bjv909,1556805492,AITA for asking my husband to always lock our door so his aunt would stop bothering us?,"Long post, sorry! I can be pretty specific.

Husband and I currently live in his Mom's house even though his mom is already in a different country. His grandma and aunt also lives with us. We are currently here because his workplace is nearer and we still cant move to our own house near my hometown bc of several problems. So we are here for a few months.

So his aunt has BPD, she's 40 years old, unmarried and childless and she treats my daughter as her own which is nice. But sometimes she's a bit too much.

Im a SAHM but I still have a lot of errands to do by day WHILE taking care of our six month old daughter alone. It is pretty tiring so at the end the day, I just want to lay down and have a little play time with my daughter while relaxing with my SO.

But recently, she's getting on my nerves. She would knock every night, and if our door is unlocked, she would barge in and steal my play time with my daughter.

One time, after two painful hours of breastfeeding my teething baby, she barged in and wont stop kissing her until my baby woke up. She giggled while apologizing and left us to deal with an irritated infant until 2am. 

The last straw was awhile ago. She barged in when I was about to lie down after a tiring day of laundry, cleaning, and taking care of my baby and she started rummaging through MY drawers. I was furious and asked her what the fuck was she doing, and she was taken aback and said she just wants to check my daughter's clothes. She also peeked on my shoulder while Im using my SO's desktop while I was messaging a few relatives. Then she lay on our bed beside my daughter and just used her phone while playing with my daughter once in awhile. My daughter was starting to get irritated because it was 8pm and she wants to nurse so I thought it was a signal for her to go. But she then asked if she could just bottle feed my baby and be the one to put her to sleep. I refused. I went downstairs and asked SO to get her out of our room and to lock it. She wont leave at first but I was so mad my voice turned cold and told her I was tired, baby was tired, husband was tired and she needs to go.

When she left, SO and I had a heated argument because he thought I was being too rude and his aunt just wants to play with our baby. I told him our daughter stays downstairs with them while Im doing chores until dinnertime. And I just want to rest and have private time with my daughter and husband from 8pm onwards. I asked him to set boundaries but he said I should just give his aunt a chance because she never had kids. I just want the goddamn bedroom door locked and be undisturbed from 8pm til morning. So, am I the asshole?

TLDR: aunt in law always want to stay in our bedroom all night, not considering if I want to rest, invades my privacy and wont leave unless asked. Asked SO to set boundaries and he thinks it's disrespectful. AITA?",False,not the asshole,399,122,0

c11rq3,1560630656,AITA for being upset and reacting rudely for the way I was told that my dog died?,"Quick background info:

Thirteen years ago my family adopted Sierra when she was about 6 months old. I was nine. In short, she was the most amazing dog you could ever wish for and was adored by absolutely everyone who met her. My family worshipped her and gave her an amazing life. 

Fast forward to the present: I have moved abroad (to Central Europe from Oregon) and keep in  consistent contact with my family, often via a group chat. Anyways, yesterday I was at work and things were slow and so I checked my phone. I open the group chat and see a message from a relative commenting how sorry she was that Sierra passed away. I was FLOORED. I had had no idea.

I scrolled up about 10 messages and saw a message from my mom (to the group chat) stating that our doggo had gotten very sick and the vet advised that she be put to sleep. There were some pretty graphic descriptions of how sick she had gotten. I hadn't been told that she was sick.

Most of the other messages were about how they are waiting to break the news to my 5yo cousin. 

Honestly, alongside the immense sadness I felt hurt and a little angry at the way I found out. Later in the day I texted my mom privately asking if they had told the 5yo cousin, and she responded with lengthy text about why they don't want to break it to the 5yo until his mom returns from a business trip (which I think is absolutely the right way to handle things with a kid that age). My emotions boiled over and I responded sarcastically ""I was thrilled to find out in the group chat."" 

I know that was a shitty thing to say. But it turned into a huge argument that ended with my mom telling me that the other relatives (who only saw Sierra at holidays maybe a few times a year) were just as close the dog. 

Well, no. I grew up with that dog, she was one of the only constants in my somewhat tumultuous upbringing.  

I'm hurt that I found out so indirectly and that the importance of Sierra in my life wasn't considered, and that no one asked how I was doing. I shouldn't have responded with sarcasm, but the way I was told has added to the intense sadness I am feeling.

95yglq,1533835402,AITA If I avoid my stepmother and stepsister?,"So, let me explain. I am 13, and my dad and stepmom have been married for over 5 years, but she and her daughter have been living with us for 7 years.

I'm a bit of an odd kid. Socially awkward, get pretty good grades (High As), and the way I like to do things can sometimes be confusing if I don't explain my thought process. My dear stepmother doesn't like that, at all. She also doesn't like that sometimes I can't hear or see her, or what she's doing, because I was born with amblyopia in my right eye, and issues with my ear. I got the amblyopia fixed, but I still need to wear glasses most of the time. I also had 2 sets of tubes in my ears, and 2 reconstructive surgeries for my right ear, which I can barely here out of. My stepsister, she just has an issue with me in general, because A: I'm a boy, and she never got used to having a brother, and B: I act oddly, or as she puts it, not normal.

My stepmother dislikes my biological sisters, and treated my stepsister like a queen among the children. She ruled the bathroom with terror, and when the basement got finished, she and our stepmother kicked my older sister out of the room that was originally belonged to my older sister to make her live in the basement because she didn't like basements. 

I started actively avoiding when I was around 10, and in 6th grade I asked my stepsister why she hated me so much. She didn't respond, so I began to go to my room. She grabbed the hood of my hoodie, pull it back, and said because you are a disgrace to the family name. Total B.S. because we don't even have similar last names.

A little over a year and a half ago, my sister moved to live with my mom full time instead of the 50/50 split that we had had for the last 6 years. So, I moved into the basement. It is great because I don't have to deal with my family as much as before, but it sucks because if anyone wants to go to the basement, I have no privacy until the leave, because my father had the absolutely brilliant idea of putting a glass door in the basement bedroom. I don't even have a curtain to hang behind the door.

In October of last year, my little sister and I moved to my mom's house full time like my older sister did. But that's only for the school year. It was back to 50/50 in the summer, of which today is the last day. 

This week, I have had a separate instance with my stepmother and one with my stepsister. The step sister one happened earlier, so I'll start with that one.

I get a cup of water every night, to drink before I go to bed. If I don't my throat will get sore. Earlier this week, I got water when my stepsister was in the kitchen. She muttered under her breath something along the lines of ""Why can't you just go away?"" So, while I was filling my cup up with ice, I said, in a conversational tone, ""You don't have to be rude, I'm just getting a cup of water."" I then went the sink, (Where she was), said ""Excuse me,"" in the most pretentious voice I could, grabbed the jug of water, filled my cup, set it on the counter, and walked t on the basement, all the while she was giving me the death stare.

The incident with my stepmother was the next day, right before dinner. My stepmother said ""Ladies first."" And I said, ""Okay."" And my little sister went to get her dinner. About 2 minutes later, my little sister was in the middle of getting dinner, and my older sister was still in her room. Since my stepmother was in the laundry room, and obviously not attempting to get food, I grabbed a plate and was about to get some food when my stepmother said ""Ladies first."" and made me wait 6 or 7 minutes for my older sister to come downstairs, and get food, and wait for her to get food, then I could get food.

We've been talking for a while about adopting a dog when I move in and I've been researching rescues and sending my mom listings for potential dogs. I move in in about a week, but until then I'm on the other side of the country.

On Saturday, I sent my mom a listing for a pretty cute puppy and mentioned it will be at an adoption event that day in case she wanted to do a meet and greet. A few hours later she sent me a text that she has adopted the puppy and is bringing her home.

Now, this wouldn't be a big deal if it was her dog, but we've been very clear that this is MY dog. I'm the primary care taker for it, she expects me to refund her the adoption fees, I'll be the one picking out a vet, taking it to training classes, etc.

I blew up at her for adopting the dog without so much as a phone call to consult and let me make a decision. She says that she considered the dog to be approved by me since I sent her the listing, and that ""what else was I supposed to do?"" at an adoption event. She hasn't done any vetting of the dog since ""all shelter dogs are the same"" and didn't bother checking if the dog is suitable for our family in terms of health needs or personality or energy levels or anything (shes only had purebred dogs before). She also asked, ""Do you want me to take the dog back?"" But then got upset when I said yes, we'll have to take the dog back if it's a poor fit for us.

djh8h1,1571367386,AITA for possibly getting my neighbor evicted?,"So I moved into an apartment complex a few months ago. The way the complex is set up, there is a path from the parking lot to a group of 4 apartments; two are on a balcony up the stairs and two are below the balcony (I live upstairs). My roommate and I moved in pretty fast with only 5 days between doing a house tour and signing the lease. We had met the neighbor a day or two later and he seemed overly friendly. Then on day two of living there, we heard him yelling about something (I mean full on screaming), threatening to knock their teeth down their throat and he was going to call the cops. I never saw anyone out front walking by and wasn't even sure if the people he was yelling at were real. For the next week I would hear him almost every day and sometimes multiple times in the same hour; sometimes I would even watch from the peep hole in the door just to try and get a glimpse of the person he was yelling at. There was also a few times when it would be about 1-3 in the morning and he would just be sitting on our joined balcony talking about how he was in the CIA, but ""\[he\] can't talk about that.""  


One week his car battery had died and he asked me if I could give him a jump and follow him to a garage to replace the battery in case his car died. The guy at the shop said it could be a few hours so I drove him home. On the way back he explained (without me asking at all) that he thinks one of the neighbors downstairs is having an affair with one of the people in the leasing office, who supplied them with a key for his apartment to rob him. The wife was also going to all the shops he goes to and was badmouthing him to the women he was trying to get with. So while it sounded like some kind of paranoid fantasy, at least I knew what he was yelling about.  


So this has continued for the past few months and I have brought it up with the leasing office a few times, who said they were going to look into it. They sent me an e-mail telling me that some of the other neighbors reached out to them that it was happening, but I didn't hear much follow-up and he was quiet for about 5 days so maybe they sent him a warning or something. I also kept a notebook by the door to write down the topics of his rants (they asked me to). Anyway a few nights ago it got really bad; it was almost 11 at night and he is just screaming down the stairs, screaming in the parking lot, and I'm trying to sleep. So the next day I hand in my long page of notes and as she is looking it over, she says that even one of these threats could be grounds for eviction and she would have to talk to the property manager to see how they will proceed. Honestly I just want him to stop yelling, but my roommate and I are too worried to confront him about it directly as we don't want to be the focus of his angry rants.

I will try to make this short while adding all relevant details and I also want to make this as equitable to my wife as it is to me and even though I feel she is wrong, I wouldn't be posting here unless I was self aware enough to admit some fault. 

I got married to my wife on March 9th. Her parents agreed that if we had a small and cheap ceremony they would pay for 100% of our honey moon and allow us to stay in their house (they plan on retiring there in a few years) for 3 weeks. I wasn't aware of this but one of the conditions of this was that my wife and I were supposed to stop in and say hello to multiple sets of their ""Belize friends."" I think all told it's 5 different couples that we were supposed to make an appearance. As of yesterday, we were on couple 4 and while I was sort of annoyed that I wasn't made aware of this, couples 1 through 3 were nice people and the second set was these two hilarious gay dudes named Rod and Pete and Pete owns a helicopter who flew us all around to see the sites and that was awesome. 

Couple 4 was where shit hit the fan. They were much older, had obviously been fighting with each other and were super agitated. It was about 1000 degrees inside their house and they just sat and bitched the entire time about how their kids never call, how the husband's alcohol problem had flared up again, how the wife wanted to die because of her plantar fasciitis. We sat in these people's sweltering living room or almost 6 hours (that's not a joke) and we weren't offered so much as a drink and when I finally said I'd like some water, the kitchen was filthy as were the dishes and the husband was so shitty because I took a bottle of hot Dasani from under the sink. 

When we left,  I lost it with my wife. I told her that was one of the most miserable experiences of my life and those were two of the most miserable people I've ever met. She retaliated that those were two of her ""dearest friends"" and I was being super ungrateful to her parents who were paying for the trip. I told her that I wished her parents had made it clear that spending a full work day with American gothic on opiates was a condition of the honeymoon. She got so pissed at me that she called Rod and Pete to pick her up and I haven't seen her since yesterday evening. Her phone is either off or dead as my texts are not showing as delivered. I don't know how to get to their house even though its not that far so I'm just sort of hunkered down staring at my phone not sure what to do.

c0s7db,1560564330,AITA for confronting my MIL for starting repairs on my home without my permission while away on vacation?,"Okay, a little backstory: My fiancé (28M) and I (28F) live directly next door to his parents, in their guest house. His Mom is a stay at home, father works long hours. We are very fortunate to live here, have low rent and work from home. For the most part, we all get along great and all enjoy being around family. We help his family with maintenance around the property, cook for them, etc. Life is good. 

My finance and I had a vacation planned for a friend’s wedding, and a day before we left for vacation, a leak began to form seemingly out of nowhere in our home. We spent time sourcing it, and ultimately decided it was a slab leak. We cut off the water in our home to prevent further damage, pulled up the carpet and begin running and rotating fans immediately. We phoned insurance and were informed they were backed up anyway with recent flooding in our area, so they wouldn’t be able to come evaluate the situation for at least a week. 

We stressed on whether we should cancel our vacation, but Mom insisted it wasn’t necessary and we could deal with repairs when we return. With the water off, there was no further damage occurring. So we indeed went on vacation, for 5 days. We inquired about any updates while we were gone, but heard nothing back from his family on the subject. In hindsight, we should have prodded more but were busy with festivities.

When we returned home from vacation, it looked like we were robbed, but instead of the robber taking our possessions, they just moved everything to bizarre locations and cut into the walls. Our kitchen drawers and whatnot haphazardly stacked in the living area, closets rifled through and rearranged, drawers open, private accessories exposed, decorations and books slung about the house, etc. The only thing that appears to be in the same place is the bed.

Turns out within hours of leaving for vacation, Mom decided to proceed with repairs without insurance and without informing us. For context, she had to move everything because she elected to pull all the plumbing up from the slab so it’s all going to be above ground moving forward. So anything near plumbing had to be removed. 

We confronted her and asked why she didn’t contact us when the plan for repairs had changed. She simply stated “I didn’t want to ruin your vacation.” We told her we would have very much liked to know what was going on in our home and with our belongings. I’m a very private person, and the last thing I wanted was my future mother in law putting her fingers in all my pies.

ch5h3q,1563956926,AITA for telling my gf I know about her plastic surgery during an argument?,"I've been with my gf for about 4 years. When we first met she was carefree about her appearance. She took care of herself but never made a big deal of it. In case anyone wonders why I'm even with this girl, I should also say she's usually a warm and interesting person, extremely bright and has great potential in a prestigious field, even if of late she has gotten complacent and hasn't been challenging herself.

In the past couple of years she has become more vain, to the point every few conversations are about how she looks, or how her clothes or makeup are. She used to work in a field tangential to plastic surgery, although not anymore, but we find ourselves talking about the subject a fair bit. 

About a year ago I found out she'd had work done before we met, when I saw some pictures she'd posted on social media. She's since taken them down, and it didn't really surprise me because she had teased me multiple times with questions like, if she'd had work done, do I think I'd be able to tell? Either way, it was before we met and she'd always denied having had work done so I didn't think it my business to mention.

As well as being concerned with her appearance, she has also always been critical of others. She wouldn't be able to look at a picture of a female celebrity without commenting on what she considered their flaws. The only people who escape her criticism are her sisters, who she's very open about also having work done. I always just brushed over it and neither agreed nor disagreed.

A couple of years ago though, she started commenting on my female friends too. These aren't even people I meet anymore, but we'd see their holiday pictures on social media, and she'd make passive aggressive comments like, your friends aren't very pretty are they? Again, not wanting to stir the pot I usually just shrug. I mentioned several times that they're my friends and not to be so critical but she's carried on passive aggressively. This has gone on for a couple of years. 

Eventually when she criticised them, while also with the same breath talking about how she's more naturally beautiful, I told her I knew about her plastic surgery and not to be disingenuous. She obviously wasn't expecting this and we got into an argument about me bringing it up. She felt blindsided that I knew, while I felt I needed to put my foot down on her being so critical of everyone, including my friends.

About 3 nights ago my relatives including my father were drinking and when we were about to go to sleep and i was in my room, my father started an argument with my mother which he argued word for word ""you alway choose the kids over me"" and he kept rambling about how mother doesn't love him (which is bullshit btw) and wants to leaves for his aunt's house. My uncle wanted to sort this all out when my father makes some really asshole comments about his relationship with his wife but my uncle takes it and offers to calls a taxi but then some other things happen that i couldn't hear the rest but father just goes back to sleep and it that was it.

Fast forward to last night my father was drinking again and want to leave for his aunt's house again. This time he comes to my room to tell me that he will no longer be my father that i am no longer his son and i was fine with that (he's a real asshole to the family) but after seeing my reaction, he then goes to my sister who's 12 to her that he will never come back. My blood boils just thinking about it i swear he just wanted to get back at my mother and he doesn't give a shit about us. After a lot of shouting my mother calls his aunt asking for her address so they could sent father there but what a surprise, his aunt didn't want anything to do with father and he goes back to sleep.

This morning we went out to the mall as a family and father pretents nothing happenned last night and calls me son while hand me a hat, I wanted to kill him so fucking bad and i just pushed him away shouting at him. My mother then pulls me inside the mall and tell me to stop being an asshole and embarrassing the family in public. When we got back home, my mother tells me to forgive father because he's my father and he gave me life, raised me. This is pretty much how it's always been my father does something asshole and my mother forgives him because that's how he is. but this time the excuse is that there is a ghost or something possessed father and that why he's like that and some monks are coming to fix him. and the whole family thinks this, thats why everyone is tolerating him.

chqvxo,1564076249,AITA for wanting nothing to do with my mother in law anymore?,"So throwaway: boyfriend uses reddit. Risky but hey fingers crossed. I’ve been thinking about this issue and wonder if I’m TA.

Some info: he’s a college student and lives with his mom, somewhat dependent and works for the family business. He works every day and barely gets a day off. When he started he took his mom’s hours, which means she doesn’t have to work or close up with the agreement that it’s temporary until he could get another job. He has a car under his mom’s name meant for him. She takes out weekly payments from his check for the car and they both pay half.

So my BF was looking for a new job. He told me several times how much he hates working there and wants out due to money/scheduling issues (causing strain in our relationship). My dad found him a job with more pay (although his mom says it’s less and I disagree) but with a 40-55 min commute. He was very eager about the job and we did as much as we could to make it work like using important savings money that we don’t touch but we needed it. He spoke to his mom about the job after the interview and she said that it’s not worth it, the commute is long and less pay. He was upset about it but continued because he knew that he could go through with it. That was two days ago. 

Now yesterday after he signs papers and gets everything needed, he gets a message from his mom to go home so they could talk. He does and it went bad. Somewhat of a long story short: she said if he accepts the job, she threatened to cut him off. No car, no food and to find his own place. To avoid that, she said he would have to continue working with her. Now the new job is a pretty good pay, but not “I have to be a full adult now and maintain myself with no car”.  She’s “worried” he’ll struggle financially and leave his studies behind even when he tells her that he won’t and he worked it out. But she remains firm.

So the part where I’m possibly TA. As my BF is telling me all of this, I talk to my dad because he and his superior gave my BF a recommendation to work with them. Of course he’s upset but tells me that he can’t do much except talk to his superior and say it couldn’t work out. I’m feeling helpless, I start to cry and get angry at my MIL, and horrible at controlling my feelings especially when it comes to my BF but I just want to help. He expresses how he feels, I try to help. I know, and he agrees, that she does this because she doesn’t want to pick up the hours he’s working by restricting new opportunities. Then I say I don’t want her in our important stuff anymore (wedding, children, etc.) because of this. He tells me that he doesn’t agree with me because that’s his mom and he couldn’t do that to her.

So AITA? I do feel like I am because I got selfish and made it about my feelings. Then I feel like I’m not because we worked hard for the job and spent money for nothing. Just for him to decide to stay working with them and continue to be miserable. But if I am TA, how do I make it better? I don’t know how.",False,everyone sucks,6,50,1
dccwpf,1570035044,AITA for telling my coworker/friend they said something that made me uncomfortable?,"Background: I work nightshift in a lab that is usually like 10 guys. They probably see me as the slightly feminine guy but treat me like a normal member of the gang.

The guy who sits next to me is really progressive (we'll call him Michael). We aren't just coworkers but friends. Play video games together, have a few beers after work, send memes, and constantly kid around.

One day a week Michael works late because he plays volleyball in an adult league for fun. Last night he came into work and I asked how it went and we joked a bit. He talked about this individual he was fascinated with because he ""didn't know what pronouns to use."" They were ""ripped like a man but beautiful like a woman."" I laughed and asked if he got them digits (Michael is married with kids) and he just kept looping back to what they looked like. He was really unsure of their pronouns and extremely ""interested in their chromosomes..."" 

Then Michael said he ""really wanted to know what they had between their legs."" This completely changed the tone of the conversation for me. I immediately said, ""woah! reel it back, pull it back in, yikes pump the breaks"" talking over him as he says, 'what? what? It would be really fascinating to know right? Because genitals are weird. Right? Like I just want to know if they are a man or a woman."" I said people are people and genitals don't matter. That's private. At the end of the day there was an itch in the back of my mind telling me not to be passive because those comments will happen again (have happened before). So.. I texted Michael trying to be as least confrontational as possible.

I said I didn't want to make a big deal outta anything but I was really disappointed by some of the things he said after volleyball; reducing a person down to what they have in their pants. The statements turned them into an oddity or spectacle to gawk at. I know it was absolutely not the intention of the story but I felt like I had to mention it. ""In the future could you please not use rhetoric that objectifies people while around me? I would like to iterate that you're a kickass engineer, you bring joy to everyone around you, and I am excited to get to play League with you.""

Michael responded with ""hmmmm it's a tricky thing to express to people that are sensitive about such things..."" and proceeded to retell the story and say he wasn't objectifying anyone. 
 
I said again I was specifically put off by the comments about needing to know what they had between their legs and it made me uncomfortable.

Michael came back with: ""My bad... As I said, I'm curious.... But then again I take everything apart because that's how I understand... Sorry to have made you feel uncomfortable.""

All the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but I told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.

Things worked pretty well at first but over time I caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. After the third or so time I sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. They all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and I told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.

I came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. I see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead I just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave.

I got a girlfriend and she stays over fairly often, (4/7 days a week) but shes very conscious about her footprint here and basically only uses water to brush her teeth and go to the bathroom. She showers at her own place before coming over, she doesnt use the kitchen or do laundry, or stay around when I'm not there.

I said sure, do what you want, if you want to find a sublet, just make sure they're not a serial killer and let us meet them first. He never gets around to it and just leaves.

Then when it comes time to split utilities, he gets all upset that he shouldnt have to pay utilities since hes living in two places at once. I told him that hes free to make whatever life choices he wants, but I'm not subsidizing his financial decisions and I dont think it's fair. He then says that he doesnt want to pay for my girlfriends utilities either and she should pay his share because shes always there. Of course, my gf said she'd be willing to compromise and chip in a few dollars a month, but didnt think that having to pay 50 dollars a month is fair for the amount of utilities she uses.

cbjb7f,1562778131,"AITA for refusing to do Thanksgiving with my boyfriend’s family every other year, even though I previously agreed to?","I am generally all about sticking to your word, but this one has me in a corner. Early on in our relationship, my boyfriend and I agreed that since we wanted to spend holidays together, we’d alternate each year between his parents and my parents for Thanksgiving. Both of our sets of parents live within 30 min of us. The first couple years, it went well. Then, out of the blue, his parents told us one year that we would be going to have dinner with their extended family. Cool. Except his extended family lives a 5 hour drive away and they want us all to drive up there and back together. And we would be staying all weekend, Thurs-Sun.

It was a lot, but it was his year so I agreed. It was mostly great, but his extended family lives in the boonies with no internet access or cell reception. I got back Sunday night to a bunch of angry emails from my boss. I work in a demanding field where the expectation is you pretty much be available 24/7 unless you tell people (and even then it’s frowned upon). I explained that I hadn’t realized I wouldn’t have any access, accepted the reprimand, and moved on.

The problem is, for some reason, his parents now insist on doing this every year. According to my boyfriend they have always hosted thanksgiving at their house, but now they’ve decided his extended family will host every year.   So every other year, I am expected to take the car ride over with the family and spend the whole weekend there. I’ve done it twice and it’s always pretty inconvenient.

It’s his year again, but I’ve found out that I have been invited to go to a work conference shortly after thanksgiving this year. Because of prep, timing, and travel arrangements, I’ll need to fly out the night after thanksgiving. I told my boyfriend and offered to still come up there, but leave early by myself. He got upset. Apparently his family will find this incredibly rude.

This led to a fight where I finally said that I don’t want to go to his extended family every other year. He argued that I’d agreed to it and it was only fair, but I feel that this is way more than I agreed to and is unreasonable. We spend half a day with my family on my years and only have to travel an hour round trip. We spend 4 days with his family and travel 10 hours round trip to somewhere that’s so isolated, I can’t even respond to a work emergency, which makes me look bad.

I told him I wasn’t willing to do it anymore if his parents insist on going to extended family’s. At most, I’d be willing to do it every third year, and do the other two years with my family. He thinks this is incredibly unfair, since I previously agreed to split evenly and since it means his parents have to either choose to host every other year (and not go see extended family) or only see him on Thanksgiving every third year.

I (23F) recently got engaged to my boyfriend (23M). I knew it was coming, but it still took me by surprise. We haven't set a date, but am targeting spring 2021.

I also recently have been looking at breast reduction surgery. I am 5'5"" with 28J breasts. While they are a huge part of who I am, and who I am in my friend circle, there are lots of problems with them. My back and shoulders hurt. I have to buy bras from the UK for a small fortune. I can't run any more, and that is how I love to get my exercise, etc. Walking down the street I get a lot of looks and rude comments. You can google big breast problems.

I haven't talked to my fiance about getting breast reduction surgery, although I will. He obviously loves how I look, particularly my breasts. He really loves them. 

I plan to eventually get surgery, and have talked to a surgeon to get information. I have been slowly thinking about it for years, and went to see the surgeon for a consultation the day before engagement and was going to talk to fiance. I floated a joke a year ago asking how he would feel ""if my boobs fell off"" and he was horrified. I'm not sure I want to wait 2 years. I have no idea how he will react if I say I want to do this, nor my sisters who often tell me how jealous they are of me. My friends are all jealous. My mother would be likely to flip out.

Edit: Thank you everyone! The surgical consultation and engagement both only happened last week. I haven't talked with him yet because everyone is going crazy asking about the wedding, ring, planning, and apparently how many children we'll have. I can barely think straight with everything going on. Maybe I'm just scared what he will think, but I am definitely going to have surgery eventually. Maybe as people said below I should do it soon, before the wedding and see how it goes. I'll edit this once I have the conversation with him. My surgeon thinks it could go through medical insurance as a medical requirement, but that's TBD.

bgl9ip,1556051280,AITA for telling my mum she is selfish for not including me in the scattering of my dad’s ashes,"Hi all. First time poster in this sub. Thanks for having me. 

Context:

So at the beginning of March my father passed away from a long and horrible illness (PSP if anyone is interested. Not the game console - afaik it isn’t deadly). His funeral was mid-March and my mum has had his ashes delivered. 

It was in my fathers wishes that his ashes be scattered in a local river that he loved and somewhere in his home city.

Judgement needed:

Today my mum text me to say that she is going to scatter his ashes on her own because the river meant something to her and my dad, and had nothing to do with me. I called her selfish because although I was not born locally I consider this home and would be distraught if he was ‘put to rest’ without me. I have said goodbye to him but I see this final act as closure on the grief of losing my dad. 

I feel horrendous for calling her selfish and shouting at her. I have cancelled an afternoon tea we had booked this week and told her not to come round mine for a BBQ on Sunday which was going to be for my engagement planning.

bsy7rs,1558811209,WIBTA if I voiced my concerns about my cousins marriage?,"Sorry for mobile formatting 

Yesterday my cousin graduated. The whole family came to celebrate, but my cousin spent almost the whole time in her room. She only came out when her mom asked her to. I asked her to join my brother, her fiancé, and I for Mario  Kart. She agreed and we were having fun, but every now and then her fiancé would get annoyed at losing and say something. She seemed tired of him throughout the entire game, and we only played one round. Whenever her brother poked fun at him she’d just kind of support him, but not in a joining the fun kind of way, more of a quiet agreement. They spent almost no time together, other than when we played Mario Kart, but, again, when she did spend that time with him she seemed tired of him. They showed no sort of romantic connection and they didn’t act like a couple at all. I’m worried she said yes out of pressure, just because he proposed.

To be fair, that’s the first time I had met her fiancé, and it’s been six years since I last saw her, but she doesn’t seem to like him enough for him to be her fiancé. Her age also worries me greatly. From what I’ve seen I worry that her marriage would be unhappy, or end in divorce. I know that might be a bit of a leap, so I’m not sure my concern is completely valid.

Would I be the asshole if I talked to her about their relationship? I want to make sure she really wants this, and that if she does she knows that at the very least she can wait till after college. She quite stressed as is about going to college. It’s been so long that it may not be my place, and my understanding of their relationship is very shallow. I don’t want to offend her by asking or voicing my concerns.

Edit - I do not want to end their relationship, nor do I want to advise her to end it. I do want to make sure she is completely sure of her decision. She is a high school graduate as of yesterday and I just worry she’s moving too fast. If I were to bring it up and she expressed how sure she was, or that she would rather not hear my opinion that I would stop immediately and apologize.

cgw0p2,1563904653,AITA for “Bragging” about my success to my awful year 8 math teacher.,"Mrs x (year 8 math teacher who for some reason had a vendetta against me)

A bit of backstory before the situation. 
In year 8 I was pulled down a class because of my attendance so instead of set 1 I was put in set 2. The school hadn’t realised that while I was off I was doing a lot of work and it wasn’t just a day at home (I suffered really bad with anxiety and had an undiagnosed learning disability without support). I was instantly doing well getting Bs and Cs while most my class were getting Cs and Ds and some Fs. I was trying so hard and this teacher ridiculed me for making a mistake and said I wouldn’t ever make it back to top set let alone get an A in any mocks/GCSEs. Luckily we were handed off to another teacher as she decided to tutor year 11 in my classes lessons. This teacher always supported me and told me to prove mrs x wrong and said she’d do everything she could to help me achieve what I’m capable of.

Fast forward 18 months and I just got my year 10 mocks back with As and Bs in math and am sitting comfortably in set one with no chances of moving down (unless I mega flunk a test with a score of 9/100). 

Mrs x  hasn’t spoke to me all year and when I got my results back I said “look I got those As you said I’d never get and I’m in set one with little chance of moving down” she just gave me a pissed look and said I know.

I had my hair up in a clip but one errant piece of hair eluded my bobby pins. The son seemed to have a very severe form of retardation. While his mom shopped he walked around making a variety of noises ranging from humming and grunting to cursing and shrieking wordlessly. I have a cousin who was born like this man so none of that bothered me.

However, when I was talking to his mom he kept touching that one piece of hair that was out of my clip. I stepped back a few times but on the third time I asked his mom to get him to stop. The woman apologized and explained he doesnt understand personal space or social cues but she took his hands and held them.

A few minutes later the son broke free and grabbed my hair. This time it all fell out and he just kind of held my hair in his hand while humming. I dont like being touched, especially my hair, but even more so by strangers. It took myself and his mom to detach him. He never hurt me, there was no hair pulling or yanking, I think he just wanted to touch my hair.

That said, i dont get paid enough for this bullshit, empathy and my familiarity none withstanding, and so I asked her to take her son and leave. The woman started crying and defending him, explaining that he doesnt understand, he doesnt mean any harm. I walked her to the door and made sure they left.

My shifted ended and I went home. When I told my roommates about it they said I had been way out of line for kicking them out and that apparently that's discrimination.

bn2nwd,1557516738,WIBTA for reporting all of the bad checks my boss has written?,"Not actually me, but my SO - we're on the fence of the assholishness of this and I was wondering what reddit had to say.

&#x200B;

My SO (James) has worked for a franchise of a restaurant for several years now. He genuinely loves his job. But the last year, the owner of the franchise (Daniel) has had a lot of financial trouble and it has led to a LOT of bad paychecks for James.

&#x200B;

Daniel didn't want to pay for direct deposits so he switched to paper paychecks. Inconvenient, but not a huge deal. James and I have a bank account that has no physical branch location, so the only way to cash a check is to use the app or go to a cash checking location or the issuing. Then, Daniel decided he didn't want to pay for pre-printed checks anymore. Which meant that the app (which always declines hand written checks for some reason) and all the check cashing places were no longer an option. James had to go to the issuing bank. He even opened an account there so we could stop paying the fee each time. Problem is, the bank would never let him cash it the day he received it. Because they could see that there wasn't enough money in Daniel's account.

&#x200B;

Daniel would either ignore him until he had money or make a million excuses. He was always somehow able to get the money in there in time for other employees' (with accounts at other banks) checks not to bounce, and always eventually paid James in a day or two. Whenever we tried to file complaints with the job board they said they couldn't do anything because he always got paid decently quickly. They suggested to us that we file a police report since he's simply writing bad checks. We never did since the money always eventually got to us - plus, none of James' coworkers really believed we had such a problem with the checks since theirs never had a problem.

&#x200B;

This week was more of the same, but James threatened him with the police report since not getting this paycheck meant our power would have been shut off. Daniel exchanged the bad check for cash, so James was paid. Everybody else... not so much.

&#x200B;

Every single paycheck bounced. People are absolutely livid about it, and finally believe James about all of the shit Daniel's been putting us through. They want to file police reports for the 12 bad checks he's written.

&#x200B;

I know - this seems like cut and dry NTA territory. But Daniel's selling the franchise back to corporate, and he's only going to be here for a couple more weeks. He's a father, already lost his car, and he might lose his house. Bad checks in our area can carry up to a $1000 fine and 6 months in jail - EACH. Multiply that by 12 and it's not great.

&#x200B;

We get that legally, we're totally within our rights. But what about assholishly?

How did this get started.....

We met her friend Kavita for lunch today. Kavita just got back from Toronto's carnival and was showing us some pictures. A few of them were her wearing basically a thong.

Now for those who don't know, Toronto carnival or Caribbean style carnivals are not like Brazil's carnival. Brazil is very very tame in comparison, yes the costumes are skimpy but it's a parade.

Caribbean carnivals start off pleasant enough but end up being a public 'orgy' of grinding and dry humping.

Now her friend is married but her husband didn't go with her and she's there telling my wife about how many guys she grinded with (dozens) and how sexy it all was.

Anyway, when we got home I causally mentioned to my wife, if I were Kavita's husband, I'd never even let her wear such a revealing costume in the first place. I said what she did was extremely inappropriate and that if she wanted to go without him she shouldn't have been wearing a thong.

My girlfriend immediately retorted saying she disagrees and that if she wanted to wear a thong in public without me, she can and doesn't need my permission.

I argued back saying, if she did then she'd be single. Thongs send the wrong message to other men. It's effectively like her going somewhere and advertising that she's single and looking to hook up.

She said, that's not at all and that my way of thinking is archaic and sexist. I said that's the reality of how people and guys think.

She told two of her friends and they both sided with her saying I'm way too controlling and insecure.

My argument is that wearing a thong without me present is basically her signalling to other men that she wants to be approached and even hook up because she's being sexually explicit with her own body.

It's not that I don't want to be with a girl who'd do this, it's the fact that she doesn't understand how men think and that women themselves will think she's a whore. If she were to wear a thong on a beach or carnival party without me, I'd have a really hard time believing she didn't do it with the intention of attracting male attention.

I've been dating my boyfriend for 2 years and we are moving in together in the fall for school. He currently lives with his parents in a city about 3 hours away from our university, and I live with mine on the opposite side of the country. He has been in a bad financial situation after wrecking his car, and his construction work hasn't been giving him many hours. 

Whenever I talk to him he is always talking about his ""lazy days"" where he gets stoned and drunk and plays halo all day. 

Since I moved back to my city I've been working a full time and a part time job, and haven't gotten time off to visit him like I did last summer. In order to lock down a place for us to live in September I had asked him to check out places. I had looked online and emailed landlords, but he didn't have a car to go down to check them out. He got a ride once with his dad who goes down 2-3 times a week and looked at one place. I'm supposed to move out there in 2 weeks

**The incident in question:**
A couple days ago I was talking to him on one of his ""lazy days."" I was already pissy before I talked to him cause of work bullshit, but I asked him why he wasn't looking for places to live when his dad was down in our uni town. He said he ""wants a lazy day before he goes on his trip"" I asked him what trip he was talking about and he said he had decided to go on a two week long fishing trip with his buddy on his commercial tuna fishing boat. 
I flipped out and told him I was really worried about finding a place to live and now he's gone for two weeks and I'm supposed to move out there in two weeks. He said his dad could look at houses and he needed this trip to make money. I was yelling at him and telling him he was immature and that me and his dad was doing more to help us find a place then he did.

Hey Everyone,

​

So there I was driving down the street and I could see a dude on a bike about a quarter mile up. I'm watching him as i approach to avoid hitting him, and I see his wallet fall out! I honked and pointed but the dude flipped me off and continued on. I pulled over and picked up his wallet. He has a crisp hundred dollar bill and a few photos and debit cards, ID etc.

My first reaction is to keep his money and continue on with my day, but after seeing the photos of his very young kids I could tell he was a new dad and prob needed that money. I recently had a child of my own and I know that feels man. So being a good person, I drove to his house ( address on ID ) which was around the corner and I pull up our front and park.

Now...lets call our missing wallet dude ""john"" for obvious reasons.. I approach the house on foot, very large and duplex style.I went straight to ""unit A"" as the ID stated and knocked. A 20 year old looking guy (possible brother) opens and I ask for ""John"". The dude immediately responds with, ""He doesn't live here, never has"". Just basically dismissing ""john"" completely. I look behind this dude and I can SEE PHOTOS of the ""john"" hanging on walls and what not. I attempt to explain the situation and the dude slams the door on my face. I'm a little annoyed now. I knock one more time to try to explain and nothing. Fuck it..I turn and walk back to my car. .As I'm walking away...I hear someone behind me yelling..

​

Low and behold...It's my guy John! He's cursing up a storm. Telling me that If I ever come back He'll kill me and to not fuck with him or his family. I couldn't believe it. I hadn't even told them what I was there for and I'm being threatened. At this point I realized this was a complete waste of time and went straight to my car. Drove off and threw his wallet at his front sidewalk. I'm now A hundred dollars richer. AITA for keeping his cash",False,asshole,987,525,1
dp176s,1572405626,AITA for separating my dog from my grandmother?,"Okay, background info. My wife and I moved into my grandparents house when my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer in order to help with his needs and the emotional support of my grandmother. We'll, my grandfather passed away shortly after we moved in, but we stayed and are now financially supporting my grandmother 100%.
     My wife and I have a dog. When he moved in, my grandmother was worried she would have responsibility for the dog while we were out of the house and she was home. We assured her she wouldn't so much as have to take the dog out to potty. (He can hold it for the short amount of time in which my wife and I are both gone) okay. No problem.
     Over time, grandmother grows to really love dog. All is well. Well, eventually dog starts to find some feces from somewhere? I'm not sure. Dog discovers he likes to roll in said feces... Okay that's rough. He's an inside dog. Dog gets let out unsupervised for an hour or so every day to potty and for exercise, but with the poop rolling, I'm inclined to take him out only on a leash for walks and potty breaks.
     My grandmother refuses to acknowledge the leash rule and let's dog out for several hours every day, and dog has rolled in poo several times and gotten skunked once. She also feeds table scraps (often food that is harmful to dogs such as onions or chocolate).My wife and I have asked my grandmother several times to please just leave him inside while we're gone or at the very least, take him out on the leash and to just feed him his dogfood and the treats we buy.. She refuses on the grounds that she knows best and that he's unhappy inside. I disagree, dog rarely asks to be let out except to potty and usually comes back in shortly after. She claims that if she lets him out, he doesn't come back.
     I've gotten to the point that I'm tired of asking for her to honor my wishes about my dog and have put a door lock on our bedroom.  We are keeping him in our bedroom while we are out. My grandmother has not taken this very well and is threatening to move out (of her own house) and into my cousin's house. My mother also says I should just let her do what she wants as it's not hurting the dog. So, am I the asshole for separating her from my dog while I'm not around?",False,not the asshole,4,7,0
cjqcnd,1564485725,AITA for not inviting my friend’s girlfriend on vacation with us,"Names and some details changed to make less identifiable. I live with James, a close friend who I’ve known since University, and his girlfriend - Amy. James and Amy have been in a relationship since his last year of uni (a few years ago), and I would also consider her a good friend of mine. 

A group of 8 of us from uni who are still very close decided to go on an upcoming weekend trip. We’ve been on lots of trips together, but this is the first time we’ll be going abroad as a group. We decided this while James and Amy were away and I had a couple of these friends round for drinks. We decided we’d organise bookings and dates etc. amongst our smaller sub-group to make things less stressful, rather than leave it to everyone going. We also decided that we’d be happy if anyone in the group wanted to bring their partners, but wouldn’t explicitly say they were invited. 

We left a couple of months between suggesting we go away and actually making the bookings so people could organise money, time off work etc. Luke and Tom, two other people with long-term girlfriends, talked about bringing them, but neither of their girlfriends were free when we were going. James saw them mention this in the group chat but at no point asked if Amy could come before we booked flights and accommodation. 

Since booking, Amy has made a couple of comments suggesting she’s disappointed/upset not to be going. She’s very quiet and non-confrontational, so I know this isn’t her just making a scene. I think the main problem is that she considered herself a core part of the friendship group, rather than an accompanying partner. 

Unfortunately, the fact is that the rest of the group don’t see her as this. She’s well liked, but can be very quiet when we all get together and is intimidated by people she sees as ""cooler"" than her. This makes people think she isn't making an effort/doesn't want to be there, when she actually thinks very highly of them (to the point where she can be very over-familiar and overly keen when she talks about them at home). Sidenote: she doesn't have anxiety, ASD, or any other condition that affects her social skills.

I feel bad that not being invited has upset her, as realising you’re not in the friendship position you thought must be devastating. She struggles to make friends, and I can tell that the one year that she hung out with us at uni meant a lot to her. She doesn’t have any friends which weren’t James’s first, and so will be on her own knowing we’re off having fun. 

It’s too late for us to book her onto the trip. I also think it was James’s call to make on inviting her. But was not inviting her in the first place as a friend rather than a girlfriend assholey when no one would have been actively against her coming, and it’s clearly hurt her not to have been?",False,everyone sucks,3,14,1

I'm a personal in home caregiver. Today when I got here, both of the overnight staff were asleep. One in the recliner, one on the couch. I walked in the room, sat my bag down, sat in the recliner and started crocheting. 

The client was still asleep, has an alarm for if he stops breathing or whatnot, and has a bell to ring when he needs something. (He lets overnight staff sleep, so that's not an issue.)

So I clocked in, and just sat there crocheting away minding my business. About an hour and a half passes, and one of the overnight staff wakes up and groggily checks her phone. She then jumps up and starts yelling at me, asking why I didn't wake her up when I got there.

Normally by the time I get here, they're both awake so I assume they set alarms of some sort. 

I let her berate me, then she stormed off and left. I only said ""It's not my job to wake you up. I'm sorry."" And then when she continued, I just let her go on but I didn't respond. The other coworker told me I'm a mega dick for not waking them up when I got there and noticed they were sleeping.

ar35jn,1550276196,AITA for not reaching out to my sister?,"This is something thats been bugging me for a while but i feel too involved to think rationally about it. 

Since probably early 2018, ive only spoken to/seen my sister twice. once for our dad's birthday, and once for christmas. Both times were brief and we behaved like normal. It's the product of a lot of things, and it feels difficult to explain because of how complicated family dynamics can get. Of course we had our petty sibling fights and we've always been completely different people, but theres one big incident I just cant seem to get past. 

In 2016 I overheard a conversation she had with my mom on speakerphone in the same room. saying now that she's found religion, she can't find it in her heart to be okay with gay or trans people. I'm a gay trans man, and my family knows this, has known this as I'd been out for almost 5 years at that point. I know she wasnt talking to me, and maybe I wasn't meant to hear, but I spoke up to ask what she meant, and then she repeated the sentiment, now actually to me. 

I definitely overreacted to this, but understand that my sister was one of the first people to ask my new chosen name. She used to be the only family member who I thought supported me. The change was shocking and saddening and my reaction to it, which included deciding i won't tolerate my identity being disrespected, led to being kicked out of my mom's place two weeks before I was supposed to move into a place with my boyfriend. Afterwards, no one really talked about it. I distanced myself, and focused on my transition and work. I never received an apology for her words which I guess I don't deserve because she was just saying how she truly feels. But I truly feel like I don't want to be around her more than necessary since I know i'll be deadnamed, misgendered, that my nieces will be told to call me Aunt, and that my boyfriend will just be my 'friend'. I'm well over a year into my transition, and I don't sound or look like a woman anymore. It's painful to experience. 

Recently, though, she's going through a lot. Divorce, with two young kids, which can't be easy. She's also isolated herself from my mom and her side of the family for an incident that, objectively, she is in the wrong for. Ive been urged to reach out to her, but I don't even know what I would do. Even one of my managers at work who knows her (his wife did my sisters laundry) approached me at work to tell me I should be there for her. Which I think is a little inappropriate but what do I know.

ek61ik,1578188366,AITA for not cutting my hair in support of my grandmother?,"My grandmother was just diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, but has a 70% chance of surviving with the treatments the doctors are going to be administering. She won't lose all of her hair with this, but is going to cut it short anyway and just wear wigs everywhere because she's always wanted to wear wigs and this is as good a time as any to do so.

My mother and aunt are getting the same haircut as her to support her in her fight against the cancer. My mom told me I *need* to cut my hair like them to support my grandmother. I told my mother that I want to support her in other ways, like doing my grandmother's chores and taking her to doctor's appointments. My mom got pissy and said that isn't enough support, then shoved her phone in my face and waved it around, showing me the haircut she's getting. 

I think supporting my grandmother at home and at the doctor's is far more important than getting matching haircuts. I help my grandmother out with household chores more than anyone since my parents work more than me and my sister can't bend due to rods in her back. I also take care of our animals daily. We have 4 ducks, 3 chickens, and two cats. The birds have to be tended to twice a day and can be a pain in the ass at times. Despite all of this, my mother acts like I do nothing around the house and just play video games all day. Sure, I do play a lot of video games, but I also make sure things are taken care of first. I have my priorities straight. 

I also don't want to look exactly like my mother because no one would be able to tell us apart. She and I have the same height, same build, same hair color, pretty much the same face, and matching glasses. I want to be my own person, and not just a carbon copy of my mother.

5-6 years ago I started working for a ma and Pa welding supplies shop with only background in automotive/concrete pumps.I was to fix the welding equipment.

The company needed to have a certified tech to maintain their ""premium"" distributor status which means the get great discounts. I was sent to the first of two certification classes within 2 weeks of starting, I passed the first test after cramming, got back & spent the next 3 months being trained by the guy who was currently in retirement. I go to the second class, pass & get fully certified & begin my career.

The owner retired the year I was hired, in hopes of leaving his company for his son whom was currently the store manager.That left his son, the top employee & the accountant all tied for heirarchy & they all wanted things differently. I steer clear of any political BS because it didn't matter to me. I was there to learn a dying trade & learn it well.

Here is where the biggest pile of shit hit the fan. That poor poor fan..

The owners son, who was 6 months away from inheriting the company was found to have been stealing from the company for YEARS, like tens of thousands of dollars... He was subsequently fired and his dad became even more checked out & left the accountant to be the general manager. Well fast forward a few years, I made a dying repair shop into a bustling repair business,with 40-60 machines in at all times in que, sent out Excel spreadsheet reports on the current status, expanded the repair shop from being a warranty center for 1 brand to all 3 major brands.

I had out grown that shop, and that they wanted to keep me at a certain level of capability that met their needs without taking into consideration that I have 40 years left in the industry.

Quickly management got worse and worse so I left this last October for a bigger company that called me at my place of work in the hopes of hiring me. The straw that broke the camel's back was the GM shutting down certain options we gave customers for repair against my will, after that I went to places I knew I could walk on to and said I was on the market. That was when this bigger company hit me up out of the blue by pure coincidence.

To wrap this up that bigger company is taking great care of me, letting me train on the high end equipment I dreamed of working on and like I said, this tradeskill is a dying trade. I'm now using my abilities and natural prowess with this type of work to give previous customers an alternative outlet for repair on welding equipment, both normal and specialty (CNC, automated sub arc, high end plasmas etc) but with the understanding that if they choose to utilize my skills I want them to bring over gas and hardgoods business, essentially taking customers from my old employer but making it 100% up to the customer....

So i decided that i would ask her out to my prom, and i would make it as dramatic as possible with a bouquet of flowers, a ukulele, and a haiku i wrote. I was planning on walking to her school and asking her, and i was expecting for her to say yes, as she's not as close to many other boys as what she is with me. Obviously, i told my close friends what my plans were a couple days beforehand, and so everyone knew what i was planning to do. So the day comes on which i plan to ask her, but then my one close friend (M18) takes me aside and tells me this, ""I know what you're planning on doing today man, but i already asked her last week and she said yes. I'm sorry."" 
This got me quite upset as he said nothing about asking her until the day came and i felt betrayed. His excuse was that he thought i was gonna ask another girl, but i don't believe that he could've not known about my plans, since i was talking about it for like a week. I also expected him to know that i had liked this girl, but apparently he knew none of it.
So in my mind i had 2 options; just leave the whole thing and find some other girl to ask, or go through with the original plans, even though knowing she'd say no, but still do it cause i liked her and i wanted to see her reaction.
I decided to go through with the plans, as i wanted to see her anyway and i knew that she'd love the things i had planned. So i get to the school and do everything, she hugs and thanks me several times, she obviously said no as she already yes to my friend, but then she invites me to her prom at her school, and obviously i said yes. 
Now when i told my friends of her inviting me to her dance, they genuinely believed that i guilt tripped her into doing it, and they believed that my friend should've gone with her to her dance. I feel though my intentions were clean, i only wanted to please her, but my friends think otherwise and now it's a bit awkward between me and my friend involved.
(Also by the way; why didn't she just ask my friend to her dance when he asked her to his? She had no idea of my plans, and so there was no reason for her to wait. This gives me hope that she had some feelings for me.)

cmg3t9,1565035272,AITA for calling a tow on a car parked in a handicap spot?,"This may be really dumb, but I have some friends that suggest I could be TA.

I live at an apartment complex that’s small and with minimal parking. Spots aren’t assigned, and you can park in the lot as long as you have a visible pass. My neighbors and I are all pretty chill and don’t call the tow on visitors unless there are no spots left. Even then, towing is usually a last resort.

Being such a small complex, there’s only one handicap parking spot. Usually people only park there if they’re actually handicap or making a quick delivery.

Now, I’m a little sensitive when it comes to handicap parking. I was in a rough accident last year and wheelchair bound for months. It was an eye-opening experience, and I realized how incredibly difficult it is to be independent while wheelchair bound. One of the biggest challenges I faced was going nearly anywhere with family and loved ones. Finding parking and getting out of a car were often a big issue for me.

Lately, a few residents’ guests have been parking there sans any indication that they need the spot. There are no handicap residents currently, but I can’t stand to see people with no placard or indication of needing the spot on their car parked there for an excessive amount of time. 

This weekend a vehicle with a bike rack on the back parked in the spot. Not only did they park there, but they parked far over the white lines often used to give wheelchair users space for their ramps and chairs. They didn’t have a resident pass to park. There were also a few other spots available.

After thoroughly checking to make sure they didn’t have a handicap sticker or license plate, I started the countdown. I gave them one hour to leave or I would call the tow.

When the hour was up, I saw they were still parked there and called the tow.

Now, my friends think I may be TA because we’re fairly low income at my complex. I was towed downtown and the cost to get my car back was a pretty big blow to my finances. 

They also think I may be TA because the person may have had a disability and aren’t able to afford to see a doctor to get a handicap placard. (I’m in the USA.)

Their final point was that I knew there were no handicap residents, so why would it matter if someone parked there?

My mother is an animal lover to the extreme and volunteers her time at an animal shelter. She recently adopted a dog and has had it for a few weeks. My mother loves to dogsit for people and this past weekend a client dropped off their greyhound. During the dropoff the greyhound was excited and ran around in the yard.

We start a conversation and eventually I ask her out. We go out date is great but I chicken out and don't try to kiss her. Next day we're at a friends house and while talking we make it clear that we both like each-other and make out. We keep talking and I ask her out again and she tells me she's not ready for something serious. I tell her that something serious is the only thing I'm interested in but I'd be ok with just getting to know her.
we don't see or talk for about a week. 
  
Next time I saw her we end up in the same group get together where we once again established:   
 - that we like each-other    
 - I don't wan't anything casual   
 -  She doesn't feel ready  
  
Nothing eventful happens for about 3 days; until, my fried hits me up just to ""hang"" I asked him what he had in mind and his response was ""just chill"". When I get there R is sitting next to the only open spot and we star watching some shows. eventually we she starts leaning on me while I didn't mind. She then reached for my hand which I was actually not ok with. I informed her that I was getting mixed signals to which she replies ""they're not mixed"" and holds my hand tightly. later on that week I asked her out and she said she'd be busy until next Monday. Monday comes around and I confirm with her @ noon no-response. Try her again @ 4 no response, same thing @6. Then I see on FB that she was somewhere else with L. (later L told me they were consoling another friend [partner cheated] and she didn't answer because she was afraid Introducing me would be too much stress) Next day I asked her about what had happened and she told me the whole bit about consoling her friend and ""I didn't have time to check my messages"" now the thing that really bothered me is that she claimed that she had not ignored the calls (when L had already told me she had). 

Now another reason I didn't contact her again was that I felt my behavior was that of an overtly jealous boyfriend.",False,no assholes here,3,13,0
cfq44h,1563652640,AITA for getting mad at my parents because they never give my sister consequences,"So my parents have always been more lenient with my sister which is pretty common with younger siblings. I'm 18 and my sister is 15. My parents were always super strict with me and gave me (well deserved) consequences for things I did wrong. Recently, my sister has been getting in trouble but my parents literally never punish her. Some of the things I did and the punishments were: staying up at night to play video games = got my phone and computer taken away for a month. Didn't do my homework = lost my phone for a week, etc. 

My sister has been caught doing similar things but my parents literally NEVER punish her. She stays up on her phone, and when my parents catch her they just take the phone and she gets it back the next morning. She's done this several times in the past few months and they never punish her. When I continued to do things I shouldn't the punishments got worse. The second time I got caught staying up when I shouldn't of I lost my phone and PC for 3 months. Until I was nearly 18, I had a bedtime of 10pm. My sister, at 15, is allowed to stay up until 11:30. 

A few days ago, my sister had a friend sleep over and they got some dude to buy them vodka. This is about 15x worse than anything I've ever done. My parents caught them because her friend started throwing up because they drank so much. My parents made my sister do the laundry and clean up, and thats literally it. They gave her no punishment for sneaking fucking alcohol at 15. We live in the US where the drinking age is 21.  I drank for the first time a few months ago, with my parents because they wanted me to  see what it was like in a comfortable environment. 

Now today they're letting her have the same friend over again. Literally no punishment whatsoever. I just got mad and yelled at my parents how they literally never punish her and she never gets consequences for her actions, etc. They got mad back at me of course which leads to me sitting here in my room typing this.

c60m3b,1561607309,AITA for forcing myself to bond with my boyfriend/fiance's daughter?,"So I’ve been dating a guy since 2012 or so and we recently got engaged this year (2019) on Valentine’s Day. My fiance has 2 kids, 20 and 18--from a previous relationship--one will be a junior in college and the other just graduated high school. Their mom isn’t involved in their lives at all and does not even live in the same country. 

However, I didn’t really meet them until late 2014/early 2015 when my then-boyfriend and I knew that we were serious. 

I’ve always got along well with the 18 year old because he’s relaxed and easygoing, but I’ve had more problems with the 20 year old girl. When we first met, she’d always try to find ways to avoid talking to me or speak awfully of me behind my back. She even stopped going over to my fiance’s house and instead chose to alternate living between her aunts/uncles’ homes because of me (this was when she was under 18 and legally under her dad’s care).

At some points, it was so bad that my fiance debated whether he should keep dating me or not, and I really didn’t want to break up with him. 

When she was about 17-19 or so, we got closer. Her dad dragged her to therapy after some behavioral problems/depressive symptoms, and we learned from her therapist that she had a lot of trauma from not having a consistently emotionally available mom figure in her life. 

Because I teach high school, I know how to get along decently with teenagers (am one of the more popular teachers at my HS) and what it’s like to be a 17-19 year old girl from personal experience. I used those experiences to kind of try and force myself and bond with her to be the ""mom"" figure she lacked. I started going to her soccer games, dance shows, and school rallies when she was 16 and a junior in high school. 

I just generally tried to show I cared for her by giving her hugs, listening to her friend/boy drama problems, and buying her things she liked. I think she likes me more now than before--I’m the first person she hugs when she comes back home from college and all that--although she is still closer with her aunts (she grew up under their care because my boyfriend was young when he had her and was in medical school full-time). She planned out a nice Mother's Day celebration for me this year too (explained that she wasn't comfortable doing it before we were engaged). She only came over 3-4 days a week when she was in high school, so it was doable. 

However, now that my fiance and I are engaged and getting married in either 2020 or 2021, I wonder if I would actually be able to handle having her long-term in my life. I feel like such an asshole for kind of faking my bond with my fiance’s daughter, especially when it comes so naturally with my fiance’s son and in light of our impending marriage. I do appreciate that she is pretty, well-liked, resourceful, and smart (attends a college that's Ivy level) but I am not sure if I love her or ever will.

It caused a discussion because my joke had nothing to do with him, or religions.

c3ojlz,1561202313,AITA for taking my deceased grandmother’s ring?,"My grandmother passed away Thursday night and she left a few things behind. One of those things was a ring that was passed down from her grandmother to her mother then her because she is the oldest granddaughter. My grandmother had the same rule. The oldest daughter gets it then passes it down to her oldest daughter.

Everything was fine and I was looking forward to this because it really is a beautiful ring and I’d occasionally pick it up out of her jewelry box to look at it when I was over at her house. The ring means a lot to me and it’s the only thing I wanted of hers. Back when I was 14, my aunt adopted a 17 year old girl. At the time everything was discussed prior to the adoption (when I was 11), my aunt and her husband only had 2 sons. She told my mom that even though she was the oldest, she wanted my mom to get it then pass it down to me, as she didn’t have any daughters. **My grandmother agreed it was the sensible thing to do and told me I could have the ring.** My mom doesn’t wear jewelry though, so she didn’t care much either way. My mom told me she’d just give it to me when she got it. For reference, I am 21 now and this adopted “cousin” is 24. I am the oldest biological granddaughter.

While everyone was cleaning out different rooms yesterday after my grandmother’s passing (She had Alzheimer’s and was moved to a facility but her home was still cluttered, that’s why we were cleaning out her house so soon after her passing. She also wanted to be cremated and has no living relatives other than her children and grandchildren so we weren’t concerned about planning a funeral), I heard my aunt and her adopted daughter in the pantry talking about how she was going to sneak the ring out of the jewelry box before I could get it since *she* is the oldest granddaughter. I was upset because my aunt promised me I could eventually have it but she changed her mind.

We all went out last night to eat after finishing up some work (we plan on doing a lot of cleaning today too) and I left early and told them that my manager texted me and asked me to come work for a few hours because a co-worker had called off sick and they were swamped. I went straight back to my grandmother’s house and took the ring out and left before anyone could come back. I took it to my apartment and hid it just to be safe. I have no idea what will happen today when my aunt realizes it’s missing.


Edit: My grandmother never said otherwise after the adoption.

**EDIT:** 

**Alright folks, here is what the will says now that I have seen it:**

I bequeath the following items of tangible personal property to the beneficiaries listed below:

Diamond ring inherited from my grandmother: My eldest daughter who is to then place it with her eldest **biological** daughter. *If she should not bear daughters, it shall be given to my youngest daughter instead who is to then place it with her eldest **biological** daughter.*

**There you go. It belongs to ME. Apparently blood ties were important to my grandmother as well since step and adopted grandkids aren’t included. The will was made several years ago after my grandfather passed away and she wanted to have it made just in case something happened to her, before my aunt and my mom had children. It is likely my grandmother simply didn’t remember the will since she had Alzheimer’s.**

Edit: Maybe this edit will make you all chill out. I didn’t know there was a will. I based it off words that had been said to me. That’s why I took it. My grandmother and I were **EXTREMELY** close. I felt it was mine since it had been promised to me and was offended that there was an attempt to actually take it away from me. My mother called me and told me that we were meeting up at my grandmother’s house once again to look over the will she made several years ago. I showed up and my aunt and her daughter (I took *adopted* out since that seems to trigger a lot of you) did as well. They looked very tired and annoyed. When we were reading the will and it came out that my mother is the owner of the ring, my aunt and her daughter began screaming at us and admitted that they were there from 11 PM until 2 AM looking for the ring thinking it had gotten lost somewhere but couldn’t find it. Since my aunt has no biological daughters, it immediately transferred ownership to my mother and she said it now belongs to me because she does not want it since she doesn’t wear jewelry. I told my mom that I already took it and she was upset until I said I overheard my aunt talking to her daughter about how they were going to snatch it up before anyone else got to it. My aunt got pissed with me and told me to never talk to her again. She and her daughter left in tears and told us to finish cleaning up on our own. The ring was the only thing left to me and it was truly the only thing I wanted, so I’m happy I got it. So here I am now, cleaning up the house again with my mom.

**LAST 

It seems most of you don’t realize how simple it truly is the execute a will. The lawyer who helped her was there with us with it in hand - she wanted to ensure it wouldn’t be lost so she kept it stored away. It doesn’t take a year and a half after the death of someone to look at the fucking will to see what the deceased is giving to someone else. My god. 

The ring that is now mine has currently been in the family for 5 generations. And yes, that does matter. Why the hell should someone who was adopted into the family at 17 (my aunt and uncle have had her since she was 16 and my grandmother already had Alzheimer’s) who has no blood ties to the family get the ring instead of the biological descendants??? Explain to me how the hell my “cousin” and I are equal in this instance. She and my grandmother were *not* close. **I** was the one who visited her every day before she entered the facility to help her with chores around the house, not her. And no, I don’t treat her differently but I do view her differently. 

And no, my aunt can’t have any biological children now. She had a hysterectomy several years ago.",1561242917.0,not the asshole,863,347,0

All of us have masters in comp sci or computer engendering with my boss having his doctorate. We pretty much have final say in anything related to the network and oversee most of the workers and the day to day operation of the network. This is where Brian comes in.

about 3 months ago Brian was hired out of nowhere and brought onto the team. Quickly we found out that the kid was a fresh graduate from college with a bachelors in electrical engendering who was related to one of the owners. This already put him on the outs with us. Almost all of us had at least 4 years experience when we were hired or went through a rigorous hiring process. Outside of him needing his hand held for the first while or so, I tried to be optimistic and friendly with him. Tried is the key word.

He's gotten on almost everybody's nerves and has made sure to make himself the odd one out in every situation. He act's as if he's better than everyone else and makes you know that. This would be bad enough, but he quickly started to complain about how we talked too. In the office when it's just the team, we try to be casual with each other and most of us will swear or make ""inappropriate"" jokes. Well, soon after he was hired Brian went to our boss to try to get us ""reprimanded"" for, as he puts it, ""Inappropriate actions"". My boss pretty much told him to calm down but Brian has made it clear that he doesn't like it and we need to change. Whenever he hears us swear he gets very passive aggressive, making sure to ""fake swear"" with us (you know how like kids will?) and direct it towards the person he has a problem with.

There are multiple other problems with him as well like his immaturity and and weird views on the media but those are not my concern. Well, with everything that's been going on with him, me and my coworkers slowly decided to simply ignore him. When ever he would try to talk to us we would ignore him unless it was work related. We stopped eating with him, we stopped allowing him to join in on conversation with us, and we pretty much ignored him unless we needed to talk to him. Apparently this hit him hard. From what I understand he's called the heads crying about this multiple times and has complained to hr who refused to do anything. Along with this, without us constantly helping him he's taken a huge hit in performance. Apparently even though he's only been on a few months my boss says the heads are looking into terminating him due to his lackluster performance.

I do feel a little bad here, we did pretty much stop associating with him abruptly and we are his coworkers.

This morning I asked him when I could expect he'd be finished, and he told me that it'd actually be sometime around 7:15, but he'd keep me posted. 7:15 rolls around, and he tells me that he and his bandmates haven't eaten all day, so they're going to go grab a quick bite, and that he'll probably be back around 8:45.

While he could have left at 7:15 when the session ended and grabbed some food with me, he said he'd prefer to save 15 bucks on an uber by getting a ride with his bandmates, who wanted to grab food.

Given that I work 9-5, this would leave very little time for us to spend with each other before he leaves for another week, I tell him that I'm pretty sad about A) having our hangs continuously pushed back to the point where we're basically just going to sleep together and B) this is the last I'm going to see of him for a while. At this point, he asks me what I want to do, and I say that I just want to spend some time together this evening before he leaves.

M:Mom

SF:Stepfather

A month ago I (17M) was diagnosed with stage three Hodgkin's Lymphoma


I am currently in the hospital because my entire mouth is covered in mouth sores. This makes it difficult for me to eat and talk, warranting a 1 week+ admission to the hospital.

One day I'm in my hospital bed, my family in the room. I get up to go to the bathroom, which includes unhooking myself from some equipment and taking my IV pole with me. I also take my phone with headphones because i'm already listening to some music.

So I go into the bathroom, which you can’t lock, and turn the sink on so they don't hear “Pshh.” I urinate in a jug because the nurses monitor my fluid intake and outtake and at this point I had already urinated twice in the jug without the nurse dumping it out. 3 times is the max I can go without it overflowing. 

Because of the noise from the sink I turn the sound up on my headphones to the maximum volume. The morphine makes urinating really slow.
Just as I finish urinating I hear three knocks on the door through a quiet part of a completely different song (I think 3 or 4 had played by the time I finished urinating) and I'm immediately both angry and anxious as I know what's going to happen next.

My stepdad says that in France (he spent most of his life there) you knock just to give people a notice that you're coming. He doesn't actually wait for you to say ""come in"" or ""occupied"" or anything. This had led to a lot of conflict at home, and now it appears, the hospital.

I yell ""NO,"" but he's already in the bathroom, door completely open (pushed into the bathroom). My penis was exposed and he seemed confused at the scene that he just walked in on. I don't even think about what I'm doing, I jerk the jug in his face and toward his body so that he is drenched in my piss from head to a little bit of his pants. I then drop the jug, push him out, and close the door. 

I yell through the door something along the lines of ""I don't care how you knock in France, in America you wait for someone to say 'come in' before you open the door."" Then I take it a bit too far in my opinion and call him something along the lines of “pervert,” but worse.

When I exit the bathroom into my room my SF is washing his face in the sink and he is fuming. My M explains to me that since I was taking so long my SF thought I may have fainted or been in some kind of trouble. He called out my name while still sitting on the couch in my room and when I didn't answer because of the sound of the sink and my headphones at full volume is when the incident occurred.

Now as far as I’m concerned, fuck that noise. We are only ever sleeping together in my bedroom, not communal areas like the shower or kitchen. My girlfriend isn’t loud, I’m not loud, no louder than normal I guess. It’s not like she’s screaming at the top of her lungs. 

I just wanna know if I’m the asshole for telling them to take a hike or what?

c77us4,1561861267,AITA for not going on my family vacation and visiting with my girlfriend instead?,"So I have been dating my girlfriend for the past 10 months now. Due to distance and other issues, we've only been able to meet once, which was over new years. As of recently, I started a new job and don't have any vacation time built up yet, so anytime I take off is all unpaid and not guaranteed.  

Based on the fact that I might not get the time off, I decided to make backup plans. I talked it over with my girlfriend and got the okay from my parents to have her up for the week my family is gone. She would take a bus up and spend the week at my house while my family was gone.

As of today, I found out that I got most of the week off, only missing 2 days of the week, which would mean I have the opportunity to drive where my family is and join them for the vacation. My parents even offered for me to use one of their cars as to not add miles on my own. One of the main draws of the family vacation is going with some family friends who we don't spend a lot of time with anymore because they moved a long time ago. 

knowing all of this, I still have decided to stay back and spend the week with my girlfriend. unsurprisingly, my family was not all too thrilled about this. My mom respects that I'm an adult and can make my own decisions, but my younger brothers were all disappointed that I would rather spend the week with my girlfriend than with them. One of my brothers took it extremely personally and was very mad at me.

My only last option to please as many people as possible would be to drive the 4 hours to stay with my family for a few days, and then drive another 2 hours to stay with my girlfriend for some time. I would then drive 4 hours home by myself.",False,no assholes here,4,10,0

aute3t,1551145578,WIBTA if I tell my boss while he's on a work trip that I do not want to train his new employee,"When I started my job, I honestly loved it. Since then, my manager's boss got fired which caused a chain of events and led to a major management change. My manager no longer had any under him and our small team of 4 in a large company got broken into two smaller teams of 2 under different managers. My close co-worker and I got placed under one of those ""professional managers"" who don't really know what you do and my ex-manager and his co-worker got placed under another new manager they promoted from an overseas office and moved to our location. 

Ex-manager quickly quit for obvious reasons (losing his position) and his co-worker stuck up with it a little longer but eventually got fed up with and left. This left an odd team dynamic as it left two people under the management of two people. I'm sure it doesn't take a professional to realize how this is a terrible idea. The new overseas manager wanted to replace his team so he started looking for new hires. My co-worker already did everything in the job description for this role since we've had to fill in, he just didn't have the title or pay increase. Many people were shocked that he wasn't immediately offered the job and that they were even considering an outside hire. (I'd like to note here that he and I were doing just fine with the two of us and had someone helping us with more trivial day to day tasks)

Managers told him that he wouldn't be getting the role and they hired someone from outside the company. This upset him... a lot... putting it lightly. He was essentially denied the title and pay for the work he's already doing. 

Today the new guy started. His manager is on a business trip at his old office, so my manager has been handling his start. Right off the bat I knew he wasn't a good fit. The new guy is easily in his 50s and very overweight. Now before someone accuses me of ageism and body shaming, my job often consists of crawling under tables, climbing up ladders and carrying heavy-ish equipment when installing new technology. I don't think I'm wrong to assume he will not be helpful in these areas. I tried to keep an open mind though and talk with him for a while. When trying to show him some of our job or have him shadow me while working, he would be constantly talking over me and try to piggy back on what I was saying. You know, those people who try to finish your sentences to try to prove they already know what you're saying? The final straw is when I got called to troubleshoot something, he met me there. While I was assessing the issue, he starts telling me what to do. I just said, ""I know"" and walked away. The worst part is that most of what he was saying was wrong.

As I said, his boss who is indirectly also mine is out of town and is expecting me and my co-worker to train. WIBTA if I told him no? I also don't want my job on the line.

Edit: I've decided to keep my mouth shut but managed to rope a few people in to ""share"" in the training. Boss comes back tomorrow so hopefully he will take a more direct role. ",1551298398.0,asshole,4,11,1
aui9yz,1551078025,AITA for wanting to vet my longtime gf's friends before they come over?,"This is something I think about a lot lately but the short version is that I only allow a couple people my girlfriend knows to come over and I hangout with new friends of hers at least once (usually movies or to smoke some weed, not like an interview or anything) before new ones have permission to come over. This started early into our relationship but we've been together five years now and live together. My girlfriend never brings it up and when I've asked her about it she says she doesn't mind but she's also fairly submissive due to her upbringing (this could be its own story so I'll skip it for now) and I often worry about taking advantage of her nature.  


For context, this is the only relationship I've ever done this in. When it first started it was because my girlfriend has friends who imo could be problematic to have around and I have a home business. The gallery includes an alcoholic who up until a few months ago would pee randomly at parties, two guys I /know/ are engaging in non-violent/non-theft felonious activities (I don't want to go into details here but this isn't just a hunch, from her stories I recognize the activity the pair are engaging in), a guy who got out of the navy (not a problem) and spends most of his time saying obscene things to women because he never reintegrated into regular life (the problem), and another guy who screamed at her while she was weezing on the ground from a panic attack once. There's also two girls who are newer and sort've obnoxious but seem alright truthfully. I've been thinking of saying it'd be alright if the pair of girls came over but all of these people are part of the same circle and I'm worried about them inviting the rest of the gang (their friend circle is very ""if x is here then the whole gang should be here"")

Basically, part of the core curriculum at my university involved taking one science class, so a lot of people who weren't particularly fond of science related material all were in the same class together.

The first exam of the semester was particularly difficult, for me despite the fact that I studied a week leading up to the test, during the exam I knew I wasn't going to do well, and that was the general feeling throughout the room. 

Halfway through the test I noticed a girl was on her phone and looking at the slides the professor gave us to study and copying down charts, and graphs. 

I told the professor what I saw when I turned my test in, and she was livid to say the least. 

I never saw that girl in class again, I wasn't sure if she was asked not to come back or dropped the class after the professor talked to her. I had to do a statement for the school's honor council, and it was my word against hers so she wasn't kicked out of school for it. 

But I heard through her friends that were still in the class that whoever turned her in was a b\*\*\*, that they should have honored the 'unspoken code between students' not to narc... etc. 

My own friends also thought I shouldn't have said anything because she had to drop the class and I may have messed up her schedule to graduate on time, basically saying that I messed with her life because she had to go through the honor council and could have gotten kicked out of our university. 

But I think she did it to herself by cheating, if she had just failed with the rest of the class she would have been fine! The professor told us after we got the results that she was going to drop the lowest scoring test from our final grade, and made the first test particularly hard to scare us (only two people got As, a handful got Bs, and the rest got Cs and Ds).

czrxif,1567636372,AITA for how I responded to a coworker's HR complaint on my behalf?,"Last week, it was my birthday. I (24F) was in the office kitchen with my coworkers “Rich” and “Brian”, who are also in their 20s. We're all pretty good friends. So we were in the kitchen when another coworker “Sandy” (40sF) came in to make herself coffee. None of us are close with Sandy but as its a relatively small office, we all know her name.

Anyway, Rich said something to me (I don’t remember the comment verbatim) to the effect of “I know we’re at work but if you think that’ll spare you from birthday punches, you’re wrong.” Rich, Brian, and I all laughed. Not for one single second did I think Rich was threatening me. Sandy didn’t say anything.

UNTIL I got a call from HR to come in to their office. I go in and the HR director asks if I’m okay and if there’s anything I want to tell her. I said no. She told me that she received a complaint about an incident where Rich made a threat against me. I was shocked and adamantly told her that it was a joke and I didn’t feel threatened at all. She said “ok, thanks” and said I could go. I asked her if Rich was going to get in trouble and she said that she couldn’t get even tell me until the “investigation” is complete! I haven't heard anything from her since.

Of course when I got back to my cubicle, I texted Rich and Brian about what happened. We figured it was Sandy who made the complaint because she was the only one in the kitchen. We didn’t confront her or anything (even though Rich wanted to... i thought it would be a bad look and possibly look like retaliation but maybe he was right?). But Rich was never even called into HR despite anxiously awaiting a call.

That brings me to today. Rich, Brian, and I were all in the kitchen this morning when Sandy came in. We all said ""Hello"" to her and she kind of mumbled hello but it was definitely an awkward vibe. I decide to fuck with Sandy a bit and ask Brian if he had any whiskey so I could turn my coffee irish. And then I turn to Sandy and say “just so you know, that was a joke.” Rich and Brian crack up but Sandy looked upset and left. She wasn’t crying but she looked on the verge of tears. I know I was super immature.

I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t think she would have reported Rich to HR if she wasn’t actually concerned about me and the look on her face after my stupid joke was genuinely gutting. I feel like maybe I should have pulled her aside and told her everything was fine woman to woman. But also SHE could have pulled me aside and expressed her concern instead of running to HR.

To make things simple I'll call them Z and H. However, a few things have irked me about them in particular. One such case was that one time we ate at a restaurant a few weeks ago: 

We were looking at the menu and had been deciding of what to eat. I've told both Z and Y of my general avoidance of spicy food on numerous occasions due to a hemorrhoid problem I've just experienced and my general low tolerance of pain. However, Y really wanted to order the 24 spicy wings platter and because Z wasn't very hungry, Y wanted to share it with me. I was hesitant at first but eventually gave in as it seemed he really wanted to try it. He was nice enough to pick the medium level of spiciness. Unfortunately, once the wings arrived, although both Z and Y found it not spicy at all, I was sweating profusely after the first few bites. I admit I was and still am a pussy when it comes to a lot of things including spicy food. I could only eat around 2 or 4 wings before I gave up. However, Z and Y made fun of me for not being able to eat any spicy food. I told them that I really couldn't handle it and that I shouldn't eat too much of it because of the hemorrhoids. They told me to stop using my hemorrhoids as an excuse and that I should 'train' myself to eat spicy food. I told them that it shouldn't matter to them whether I could eat spicy food or not as it doesn't even affect them as its just a matter of preference. They then told me about how its 'important for your future in the event that colleagues would take you to eat spicy food' and it would make me 'look like a bitch if I refused'. I just dismissed their advice and attempted to change the subject. Now, I'm in no way on bad terms with my friends due to this. It is after all a small matter.

I was born from a interracial marriage. Mom is white and dad is black. My whole family is from a small place in another city that's famous for being a place where slaves would be after they ran away from their owners while my country still had that so we have lot of black culture and I grew closer to that.

The thing is that I'm a copy of my mom. I'm a little darker (but not dark enough to go to.my dad since I'm still quite white by looking... Maybe just a little tanned) but we really look alike and I have some details from my dad that are barely visible. I was born with curly hair but I ended up straightening it because I was like too lazy to deal with the amount of hair (I have bad memories from when we didn't have many products like today and my hair was too full so I cried to brush it almost everytime).

Recently after getting into uni and shit, I've been thinking of transitioning back to my natural hair but I really can't deal with two textures (I tried before) and a great solution for that is making braids since I don't want to cut a lot at once but... Even if I grew up seeing family doing that along with other cultural things that I love, I'd still be ""the white chick"" with ""cultural appropriation"" even when it's technically my own culture. It's just frustrating sometimes to even get ""that look"" when I say I'm from that place or when I say I'm ""brown"" (for lack of better term in English, just being mixed and between the two colors, that's what I have on birth certificate but I'm apparently too white for that as well) . But if I say I'm just white, I feel like I'm ignoring another part of me. Like, I have some people at uni fighting for black people rights and I do see some people making comments about that and they seem to be uncomfortable (I have a friend that's involved but never directly talked about it) and that's what would make me feel bad about getting them.

Shortly after, I told my friend (22F) about it, and that I would need space and likely wouldn't reply to messages for a while. I felt I needed to say this because my friend suffers severe anxiety and feels as if people hate her if they don't respond.

She said she was sorry for me and that she understood, but the next day she was texting me various things, but towards the end of the day she texted ""Do you still want to be friends, or are you going to ignore me forever?"". 

I had no idea how to reply to that in my current state, so I continued to ignore it knowing she would continue to get worse if I didn't, but I just had no idea how to approach it.

Daily I would get a text pleading for a response, but it just became harder for me the more she said. Texts varied between ""does our friendship mean that little to you"" and ""this is making my anxiety worse"".

After two weeks she texted that she tries to support me when I'm upset and then she gets nothing.

I was annoyed at this as it is usually me responding to her struggles, and I keep my struggles private (would share with my then boyfriend, as well as psychologist, as I felt they could offer significant opinions, I did not share with her due to her being overwhelmed by her own life), this move striked me as manipulative, so I responded calling it out, clarified why I wasn't replying and why it dragged on for as long as it did, as well as why I was on social media but not replying (I was contacting a support group for advice, I showed her pictures of this to try alleviate her anxiety) I said it wasn't fair to rely solely on me for her happiness, and that it was unfair to expect me to always be available, when I'm currently emotionally not. I then pointed out she does the minimum, she will just say words so that she can say in the future she supports you, so she can expect support back, at this point she said she was hurt by what I had said, and she won't be seeing me again, and that friends don't get to pick and choose when they are there for eachother, and she again said she always tries to support me when I'm in a bad place, like a friend should.

He had not seen his dad in a while, and I had never met his dad before. We were also going long distance at the time. About a week or a week and a half before we left, he asked me if it was okay if some of our good mutual friends came a long (one is one of our female college friends the other is her friend). They were both friendly girls and one much more extroverted than me. My reply to him was that I was uncomfortable about it and I didn't really want other girls to come along the first time I met his dad (which is his favorite of his divorced parents) and we should plan another trip with them, but I knew they were already going to be invited and there was nothing I could do about it. He said it was just to have fun and bring them along (which was fine honestly, we did have fun, im glad they came in the end). 

However, I was pissed the whole time because we ended up waiting on them to drive in 3 hours with an extra three hour delay, instead of getting to the lake house around 5pm, we arrive around 3am and miss a whole evening of fun. Also, they had to return back two days sooner than we had planned. Additionally, my friends had shown up with a gift for the father and I showed up empty handed.

He told me he would make it up to me by taking me out on a nice date, which we did, but I made sure he did as well.

Later I talked to his sister and she said it was wrong and a bad thing of him to do and she would talk to him about it as she wanted me part of the family. 6-7 months later he broke up with me because I was ""asking to much of him"" (the most recent of several stories).

Am I the asshole for not wanting the other girls to come along the first time I met his dad, crashing our trip? I've been lead to believe I was the ass hole. Please help me weigh in on the situation. He doesn't believe it and makes me feel like I was the one who was uptight about it. 

I tried to explain everything with detail and without bias of my feelings in this thread.

Edit: I believe my response when he asked me about it was ""I did not want them to come because it made my uncomfortable, but I knew he was going to invite them anyway."" It's been a long time y'all.

3grhos,1439409748,This just happened to me at lunch. I want to know about personal space while in a public place.,"I was eating lunch out in the park and having a quiet conversation on my phone.  A school bus pulled up and a group of very rowdy students and adults from a local recreation center got off and began to play in the field.  One of the teachers brought a student over to the picnic tables.  Instead of sitting the child at any of the 11 unoccupied picnic tables in the immediate area, she sat him at the one that I was using.  Keep in mind, I had been the only one there.  All of the other tables were available.

""I'd actually prefer to eat privately,"" I said to the teacher.

""No, you're fine,"" was her reply.  

Since she obviously wasn't going to move the child to any of the vacant picnic tables, I packed up my lunch.  As I was going, I said to the teachers, ""There were all these open tables.  This is pretty rude.""  

Their collective response was that this is a public park and I don't own the picnic tables.  I agreed with them, but I persisted that they chose to use the one table where someone was quietly minding his own business.  This is like going into a movie theater where only one person is sitting in the middle of the theater and deciding to take the seat smack dab next to them.  Or getting on a bus where there are loads of open seats but deciding to take the seat right next to someone.  They are crowding someone when there is an obvious alternative.

But besides being invasive to me, it's also questionable judgement to decide that the best place to seat a child is next to the random stranger at the park.  Good thing I'm not some sicko.  Also, I think if the situation had been reversed, if the kids had been at the table first and I had just wandered by and sat down with them, the teachers would obviously be perturbed.  

So what do you think?  The teachers all reacted as if I was being really unreasonable.  With eleven open tables and only one occupied, I think it's just plain rude to choose the one that's occupied.  Yes, it's a public park.  Yes, you have the right to seat the child at the table.  No, I don't own the table.  But all that being said, to choose my table seemed like an obviously rude thing to do.  You can have the right to do something and that thing can still be a rude thing to do.

ckcgis,1564598030,AITA for making my father pay for a more expensive college out of spite?,"My father cheated on my mom and is now married to the woman he cheated with. This was two years ago.

I have refused to stay over at my father's house overnight for the past year. My father takes me out for dinner once a week instead.

He has apologized many times but I am unable to forgive him. Especially since seeing his affair partner everytime I go to his house reminds me of how he put his needs over everyone else's.

During the divorce, my mom basically got less than she deserved because my father fought her on everything.

One thing he agreed to was to pay for 80% of my undergrad and 70% of any post-grad degrees.

The remaining amounts were to be fulfilled by my mother and I (using loans or scholarships).

I got accepted to a few schools. One gave me a full ride where all tuition gets paid. I got partial scholarships for the rest.

My father and his wife are now expecting a baby. When I told him of my school acceptances, he basically begged me to take the one that would get him off the hook for paying anything.

I was really pissed off. He never even considered which program was better, which had better work programs etc. He only cared about his money.

So out of spite, I picked the very expensive private school. I was actually leaning towards a state school but changed my mind because of his begging. With this school, I still wouldn't pay anything because of the partial scholarships.

My father had a complete breakdown since finding out that he's on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Even his wife thought it would be smart to call and plead with me and saying they have take loans out. This has just further solidified my decision. I hate that woman.

My mother is not saying a word to me for or against my decision. She said it's between my father and me.

They take down our information (no credit card) and I move on with my life. 

Tuesday after June 1, we have a call from the school saying they don’t have a 6:30 class on Tuesday and don’t know how we were told there was one. The school said they had a 6:00 on Thursday. We pick up our daughter from daycare (in her leotard) and tell her that gymnastics is now on Thursday. She is sad but we do our best to keep her mind off it. 

Thursday comes and we arrive early to register. At 6:05 I ask where her class is. They tell me there isn’t a 6:00 class. Only a 5:30  on Thursday. At this point I tell them about how they told me 6:00 Thursday. I don’t understand how this has happened twice in 3 days. 

The school does take my daughter into the 5:30 so she can at least do a little bit of the class. The receptionist then shows me the schedule. None of the classes work with my work schedule. I know 5:30 is only a half hour sooner but my husband and I work till 5:30 and we’re already needing to leave early to make 6. The school said they would call Friday. They didn’t and I found another school and scheduled a trial class somewhere else. I looked online Thursday night and online they did list a 6PM Thursday class for her. 

I posted the review on Facebook basically stating the facts of what happened and that we would be going somewhere else that could figure out when the class is.

bx4de3,1559751139,"WIBTA if I kicked out my roommate and brother who's relapsed back on to heroin because I don't like living with him, knowing that it most likely will lead to a worse situation?","Some background... I am 30f, I have 2 older brothers (one is 33, the ex/relapsed heroin addict, and the other is 36).

2 years ago I bought a flat with my eldest brother. Our Dad died when I was 20 and it was revealed when I was 28 that there was some money available for me to use so I chose to invest the money into a flat that I co-bought with my eldest brother.

I lived with the eldest brother for a year. It was awful. He was horrid to me and I couldn't tolerate his treatment anymore. Too long to explain how and why, not massively relevant to my WIBTA question, but relevant enough to include so that you get that, generally, I have had a shit time with the men in my family. So it was decided that he'd move in his new girlfriend.

My other brother, addict bro, asked to move in to take his place. I was really hesitant, I have a very strained/unfair relationship with addict bro. He is not a positive or social person at all.

Because a lot of the money used to buy the flat was family/Dads money it didn't seem fair to say no to him when I didn't have another option for a roomie at that point. Besides, 'addict bro' had been progressing well/better in life in recent years, had started a good well-paid career, made some good progress all around and my flat was closer to where he works.

After a couple of relatively normal months of living with me, it became obvious that he relapsed. All the old signs are there: he's got into money troubles, he's inexplicably lost weight, he does the absolute bare minimum in general, he doesn't do any cleaning, gives me shitty attitude if I ask him for the most basic of things.. it's just fucking horrible for me and not what I need or deserve.

I feel trapped because kicking him out at this point would very very likely mean he'll spiral further into money and heroin-related problems - which is what happened when my parents kicked him out when he was 20. So in that sense, it is better for him to be in my flat where he can be seen and helped by someone in the family than to be living with strangers.

I don't feel like I'm an asshole for WANTING to kick him out, but would I be the asshole to actually go through with it assuming that the outcome of doing so is highly likely to mean more serious problems to deal with?

b33hhc,1553032535,AITA for thinking about breaking up with my gf?,"So, back story...

When we first got together, I was in a vulnerable place. I just came out of an abusive relationship. The first year and a half, everything was good. After a day of raking and burning leaves, the wind kicked up that night and blew some of the embers into the garden that was right against a side of the house. My house burnt down. With no where to go, due to the constant fighting with my granddad, I moved into her place with her parents/grandparents. Her parents took care of her grandparents. I had absolutely nothing except a car, and the clothes on my back. So I worked on establishing myself again. This is when I felt the tension and a bit of uncertainty appearing. After thinking about it, I'd come to realize it's because we were in our early 20's and we hadn't gotten any time to work on just us, cause of her super dependent family always wanting her attention. So we finally get to a place where we can move out into a house with 2 of our best friends. 

After a year, everything was going good again, but thats when it all started to get hard again. 

Both of her parents grew sick. Her mother: renal failure. Her father had a stroke. With no other choice, I decided we should moved back in to help out around the house. She agreed. Then her father died. That same year, her mother broke an ankle and busted her knee real bad from a fall, so she couldn't walk anymore, so she became dependent on us due to muscle atrophy. The next year, I lost both of my grandpas. Including the one I had lived with and had been my support even if no one else would. After some processing and kinda learning to cope with my misery, I actually started to think about everything that had happened in the past years. I couldn't figure out if I had still loved her and was supporting her because I love her or if we had an impossible situation that I'd be an ass for walking away on.  I tried to talk to her to talk to her about the situation but we didn't get far.

Then, her grandma died. Everything got put on halt again and I did the same thing I've always done. Tried to support everyone. After almost another year, the thoughts have come back, but now, because of 4 different funerals in a 3 year time span, we've both accumulated a LOT of debt that we're trying to get the reigns on again.

We each have a bedroom and ensuite and the living room and kitchen are communal. We agreed early on (we all moved in in September) to take turns with cooking dinner. As there are 6 of us, we each buy the ingredients and cook for everyone one night a week, and on Sundays we either cook together or chip in for a takeaway. I cook on Fridays. We discussed dietary restrictions early on and fortunately there were none, in terms of allergies or intolerances. However, this one roommate openly said ""heads up, I'm a very picky eater"".

Over the last 2 months we've realised that he prefers red meat, the only potatoes he'll eat are chips (fries) and he loves black pepper. On his nights he'll usually buy some form of beef, often a pack of sizzling steaks, and a bag of oven chips, all covered in black pepper.

I happen to dislike black pepper. I'll eat it if it's used as a seasoning, but when everything on the plate is crusted in it, which is how he tends to cook it, I have issues getting through it.

We've also found out that the reason he loves black pepper is that it's pretty much the only seasoning he uses. He hates pretty much all herbs and spices, and he'll complain, loudly, if any of us use herbs and spices (asking why the food is a certain colour, asking what ""those little green things"" are).

Last Friday in the roommate group chat I said ""I was thinking I'd do a chicken balti tonight. Any objections?"" The picky eater objected due to the curry, I said I could do him some plain chicken and rice, he said no, I said he might want to sort something else out in that case because the idea of the curry is it takes less than half an hour and I have an assignment to work on. He said he'd make himself steak and chips.

Then last night I made paella and roast potatoes for everyone. I told the group chat and everyone but him was on board. He said he doesn't like turmeric or roast potatoes. No suggestions for what I could do instead for him.

I did 7 portions of ingredients in one large pan, and then got a second, smaller pan. I separated out one portion of paella and seasoned it with black pepper, and then the other 6 portions got turmeric. That was the only difference. Then for the potatoes I made 6 portions of roast potatoes, and put on a single portion of pre made oven chips. He had the oven chips and the turmeric-free rice dish (which honestly was closer to a risotto at that stage as it was creamier and made in a deeper pan).

I dished it up, brought it to the table, called everyone in for dinner, and he asked why his was so different to everyone else's. I explained the modifications I'd made to his portion and he went off on me, telling me that I was treating him like a child with ""special food"" and being bitchy by not including him at all last week.

I have a friend, I'll call him Dan. He has a girlfriend, I'll call her Tri. Dan and Tri have been dating for about four years now, and from what I've heard from Dan, it's been going pretty well. Until recently, that is. Dan and Trin recently took a break from their relationship, but didn't officially break up. 

Dan and I have the same world history class, and that class has us do a ton of notes for a grade. Dan has been asking me for my notes to copy from, and I've been giving them to him. We use Instagram to text, and I send him pictures of my notes with Insta. However, Instagram murders the quality of the pictures sent, so Dan has a really hard time reading from those pictures.

The day the notes were due, Dan wasn't here, but the next day he was. About ten minutes before class started, he sat down next to me and asked for my notes, but I didn't have them on me. I told him this, and he just accepted that he was going to fail this assignment. He also had a bad stomachache, so he just sat with me until class started, not wanting to get up.

Tri apparently saw this, and she wrote Dan a note. Dan told me about the note while we were on the bus. He said that Tri basically said that she thought Dan was flirting with me during that ten minutes before class, and she expressed that she was very distraught about it, ""my eyes raw from crying,"" to quote the note.

Dan was stressed about this, and for good reason. He said that he was worried he was going to have to stop talking to me to prove that he loved her.

I asked Dan if he wanted me to talk to her about it, and he said no, and that it would only make things worse.

I'm worried about Dan, though. If Tri breaks up with him over this, he will completely emotionally shut down. I think if Tri breaks up with Dan, I should confront her about it, because 1. I'm too busy flirting with straight girls to try to ""steal"" Dan (I'm pansexual and trying to get a with a certain girl rn). 2. I'm not the kind of person to ""steal"" someone's man. And 3.

58b7on,1476894650,AITA for using the dryer?,"I live in a shared house with 3 other people. I live on the first floor with housemates 1 and 2, and housemate 3 lives in a bedroom attached to the kitchen (it's in the back of the house and you walk through the kitchen to get there). We have a dryer in the kitchen next to our washing machine and I use it the most. The other housemates have been making a lot of comments on me using it. 

The person who lives downstairs doesn't like the dryer noise. As we are students, we are often in at random times of the day and he's frequently in all day, studying/napping, because he likes studying at home and not on campus. The others keep talking up the environmental impacts of the dryer and the bills.

I hang my clothes out to dry when I can, but I am more time pushed than the others - I have university for 3 days and also a job for another 3 days of the week, and I travel to a nearby city to visit my girlfriend, so I'm rarely in the house. It rains a lot so leaving things outside all day is risky, often they end up more wet than they started. I get in at 6 - 7pm mostly, so washing can't be done until late on evenings, or on the 1 afternoon/morning I can squeeze in to be in the house - often this coincides with housemate 3 being in her room, she is there most days. 

I don't wash things late at night, I dry things on the radiator when suitable (small items that won't make the house damp if windows are left open) and I use the eco setting on the washing machine (makes the clothes less wet so they dry quicker). The bills are the same as they always have been. There are 3 other people needing to use the washing machine so generally, leaving stuff in there for periods of time isn't good (plus they get mouldy). 

Am I unreasonable for being annoyed at this? 

Side note: one of the housemates is particularly preachy about loads of things environmental related. She's a vegan and she likes to constantly point out how we shouldn't use palm oil, Nestle, buy clothes from Primark, Topshop etc. etc. so I admit, my negative feelings over this are strongly influenced by my dislike of being preached at for what damn facewash I use.",False,not the asshole,27,13,0
ci5iow,1564160751,AITA by getting into a heated argument with a camper about whether or not they have to pay for the extra time,"So to preface. I work in a state park. It's my first year here, and also the first year for the rangers we have at the park. Working throughout the summer it became apparently clear that the previous ranger had let campers get away with a lot of things, and so we are in the process of trying to make sure our rules stay enforced.


One thing that we have had issues with is people renting out kayaks, or other water transportation devices. They rent them out and then return them incredibly late past the time they have paid for, so we charge them for the additional time.


Last night it was nearing the end of my shift when a couple ladies come up and rent out a peddle boat and two paddleboards. I told them they have to be back fifteen minutes before I closed down or else I would have to charge them for additional time. 


Fifteen minutes before I am supposed to close down they haven't returned, so I close down and drive down to the beach due to the fact I'm the only one in the park at that time. I get to the beach and find the ladies and tell them they have to pay for the additional time. They refuse because they said they are only five minutes late when in fact they are a half hour at this point and I can't close down until they return. At this point thinking a confrontation is coming my adrenaline starts pumping and so I become shaky due to it. 


I continue to tell her that she needs to pay the fee for the extra time and to return the items so I can close down. She tells me to stop shouting which at that point while my voice is angry i know I'm not shouting. We say the same exact things back and forth a couple times. At which point she claims the rangers in the previous years would allow this. I explain how there's a new ranger and that we won't allow this anymore. She tells me she will talk to the ranger in the morning and pay for it. I drive off and finally close down shop.


Today I talk to the ranger about it and tell him about how I was unprofessional in doing this and should have just walked away and waited for her to come back before paying. He tells me he will deal with it and does. I was in the other room while he was talking to her about it. She kept claiming I was swearing and shouting while there were kids around. Which is untrue, but ok if she wants to tell him that.

ax1stp,1551666565,AITA for not planning to visit my parents outside of holidays?,"I'm an only child in my late 20's. My parents live several hours away, but I find the drive unbearable. Its just something personal where I really hate driving, especially alone on long trips. I would have no problems visiting if it didn't take up two stressful travel days to visit.

My mom tries to guilt me into driving down to visit often. I don't make a fuss when going over on major holidays, but I plan to say no to any more ""just because"" requests from here on out.

The holidays were recent, and I did give in to a ""just because"" trip late last year, so I had three trips in a short time that helped me realized how un-enjoyable these visits have become. I spend most of the time there on an uncomfortable couch watching TV. Its a small town without much to do. If they aren't at work, my parents frequently go to their rooms, lock the door, and get high, so only a very small fraction of me being out in the living room is spent with either of them. We do occasionally do things together, but it feels like such a small portion of the trip is spent doing anything like that.

Now, my parents aren't abusive, or manipulative, or narcissists. We weren't super wealthy, but I had a great childhood, and they put me through college, and they supported me throughout. They just miss me and want to see me I guess. We get along well, and we have things to talk about (I talk with both on the phone regularly), so the reason doesn't have anything to do with my relationship with them. I also have the free time, job flexibility, and means to make these trips as often as I wanted to. I could even afford to fly and avoid the drive. So I really have no excuse. I just find it un-enjoyable, and I don't want to do it.

When other out-of-town family members go down to visit the area (my grandparents live there as well), I know I'll get a guilt-trip-ish text asking to come down, but I don't feel like we have the same family dynamic to compare. Both my parents have several siblings, and they each have multiple children. I get along great with them all, but they grew up together as a very close-knit group. I grew up an only child with no cousins/uncles/anything that were even close to my age, so I never had family that I could be ""friends"". I grew up a bit more independently but I came to like it that way.

My parents do visit me sometimes. I don't love these visits, since I live in a small apartment with no guest accommodations, but we make it work. At least I can still be comfortable in my home. That said, my mom has some chronic, but sporadic, health issues, and shes currently not in a position to travel, so that's not an option for her in the near future.

Last point, I haven't really discussed any of this with them. I think my parents think my ""no""s mean ""not right now"".

byqr98,1560123600,WIBTA for reporting my Uber driver for picking up other passengers on the way,"For context, I had opted NOT to use the “Uber pool” option. When I got in the Uber, the driver (who I must stress was VERY friendly and personable) asked if it would be okay if he picked up another passenger on the way to my destination, “to kill two birds with one stone”. I tentatively obliged because I felt awkward, and I assumed he had the option to change the pricing from regular to pool in order to pick the other passenger up. Instead, he pulled up Lyft, and picked up two other passengers. They were also not told they would be sharing the ride, as they were both visibly surprised and had to have the situation explained to them. 
From there, the experience was fine. We were going the same way, the other passengers were no issue, and the driver truly was pleasant and attempted to make conversation amongst us. 
However, I checked, and I was still charged the full amount, as if I had ridden solo. The difference is almost $6, which isn’t a ton of money but it’s the principle more than anything. 
I am strongly considering reporting him, but am feeling super guilty. I know a lot of people who use Uber driving to work their asses off and who really need the money, the guy is just trying to make a living.

blqyou,1557237184,AITA for not telling my (now ex-)girlfriend about my family coming to visit?,"A few months ago, my long-distance girlfriend at the time and I were fighting. I should also note that my girlfriend and my brother/his wife were friends before I even knew her, but they were on terrible terms from other drama\*, and I had recently gotten into an argument with my SIL for how she was treating me while I was spending time with GF.

GF and I were texting, and things seemed better: ""You can come down and visit me this weekend if you want"". I responded that I had plans to get on a plane about 12 hours from then to visit my brother for his birthday, and she immediately recoiled: ""Now I just feel really stupid,"" ""I don't know what I was thinking,"" and that I had ""violated \[her\] vulnerable space."" I apologized for any hurt that I had caused, but she knew about these plans, and I asked if I could come see her right after my trip.

I said part of the reason why I wanted to go is because I wanted to smooth things over with my SIL, and that we had been fighting because I was standing up for GF and the relationship. GF went into a tailspin: she started screaming at me about how cruel I was to tell her that I was trying to go make my SIL feel better while our relationship was struggling, and I just listened and didn't say anything. It got to the point where she was hyperventilating; she was gasping for air as she said she had to go and hung up.

I went on the trip as planned; while there, I talked the GF into letting me come visit after, and visited her for a couple of days. While I was there, the visit was great: we were loving and calm and there was a lot of healing. She had mentioned that she wanted to come visit me the following weekend. I froze. The following weekend was St. Pat's, and my brother/SIL had already made plans to come visit. Knowing how much it had hurt her before, I didn't mention my family at all. I said that the weekend was not a good weekend to come visit; I was going to a friend's party (which was true), and given where we were at, it might be awkward and that the next weekend would be better.

Unfortunately, she saw pictures of my brother/SIL in my city on Facebook. She texted me to ask if they had visited that weekend, which I replied that they had. She said I had lied to her and that we were through. I apologized for lying by omission but that I had otherwise told the truth; I only didn't mention them because I wanted to save her feelings and avoid causing hurt, and I didn't feel like there was a healthy way to have a conversation about it after what had happened. She said I was only thinking of protecting myself and that I had removed her agency from being able to respond to the situation.

deoj0u,1570477173,WIBTA For not wanting to pay an increase in price?,"Hi, 
This is my first post here so please bear with me. WIBTA for not wanting to pay the seamstress the additional cost in this scenario? 

I sent my dress to a local seamstress to have altered after being referred to her by many local people. I had my fitting and we discussed a few changes such as: hemming the bottom, slit moved up, bra loops sewed in and the existing straps widened. This would cost 90.00.

At my fitting the option of adding some fancier rhinestone straps was discussed. I was told an increase in price would occur if I chose them, as they would need to be ordered and attached. 

The 90.00 cost breakdown was written on the back of her business card for my records and I left with instructions to contact them with my decision regarding the straps. 
 
I later decided against the fancier straps and messaged the seamstress on social media with my straps decision. I received no reply nor mention of any increase in the final cost. My message was marked “read” however. 

After a few weeks of no communication from them I grew uneasy about the lack of contact. I texted the seamstress and got a reply that she was out of town from her assistant. The following day her assistant informed me I could pick up my dress. It also now cost me 120.00. 

When I inquired about the increase I was told it was for the straps. There was no discussion with me to increase the price before she went ahead and altered the dress.

I looked at it like this : you go to a mechanic with your car trouble, they quote you at 5k for repairs. When you pick up the vehicle they say the bill is now 15k because they decided to replace the engine without telling you. You wouldn’t pay the 15k because they didn’t get your ok to do the work, right? 

I was never given the chance to decline the price increase or give the ok. Now they’re holding my dress hostage unless I pay up. 
So, with that said, WIBTA for not wanting to pay the increased amount? I’ve waited to reply to the assistants text before asking here, I just didn’t feel this was right but wanted some outside views. Thank you.

I was told it was 90.00 for alterations unless I added fancier straps that required ordering. I declined the strap change and got no response when I messaged the seamstress to let her know.

During the budding stages of our relationship, he would lie to ""keep me interested"" and once they eventually came out as lies, he fessed up to all of them (that I know of).

I caught him with Tinder on his phone sort of at the beginning of our monogamy and he claimed that it was because he needed to help his friend find a girl. The app was deleted after another talk was had.

Fast forward a few months, I see him messaging this particular girl a lot. No big deal, he has a few female friends. However, I had a particular bone to pick with her as I recalled seeing out of the corner of my eye, my bf messaging her that he ""wasn't ready yet, baby"" about something, when we were open. She ends up calling him on FaceTime when he was in the shower at 8am. The jealousy coursing through my veins, thinking that another woman thought that she was that important to my man drove me up the wall and in a moment of weakness, I went to their conversation where I found him calling her baby and reassuring her that things were going to be alright (apparently her life was pretty tough at that time and bf is a softie when it comes to women in need). After confronting him and a very long talk, he realized the mistake he had done. He claims that it's not actually cheating since he apparently never met her but I still feel like he had.

Relationships for me are something very emotionally sacred and I thought he would've known by our previous discussions that I would consider it being so. He, on the other hand, got upset that I would accuse him of such a thing. Finally, we got things going smoothly once again.

My mom then came over and reinforced that she didn't trust anyone when it came to my father. Being an indirect victim of his actions, I was deeply hurt by her words but I understood that it was something she had to let us know. After that encounter, it reminded me of all the lies my bf used to tell and started to irrationally second guess everything he told me.

To try to prove to myself that it was all in my head, I searched up Tinder in his apps (this being a few months after our first encounter with it) and found out that not only was the app redownloaded but that he had also had been active since the day before I looked. The next morning I woke up after having a ""terrible nightmare that he had Tinder and was cheating on me"" he showed me in his app search that he didn't have it (anymore). We haven't formally had a talk about it but I've pressed the fact that I feel like he should be working a little harder to gain my full trust back when it comes to his fidelity.

I went to the store to get the laxative but forgot the water. When I came back I told her I forgot the water, and she said “What? I am constipated! I need water!

So should I tell her I know she mislead me and that I can’t microwave her food for her anymore because it’s special treatment and I can’t do it for everyone? Or should I just put up with it since it’s only one more week and avoid the confrontation?

cj2sm8,1564354828,"AITA for trying to convince/push my partner to move into a house I really love and she doesn't really like with me, when I'm paying for it?","We are both around 30, have been in a relationship for over a year and are actively looking for a place to move in together. We are currently living about an hour's drive away from each other, and most of the times I will drive over and stay at her place in the weekends as she does not drive.

We have been actively looking for a house to rent together in the past  6 months, and it has been very difficult to find a good property. We both have a number of requirements and are not the easiest people. One property that I really liked and was seemingly perfect meeting all of our requirements we ended up not going for about 3 months ago as she had a bad feeling of a spiritual presence in the house that did not make her feel welcome.

Fast-forward to the present, we did more viewings and recently we viewed the first house since that one 3 months ago that I really loved and again, ticked all of the boxes for both of us, and on paper exceeded our expectations whilst being within budget. Knowing how fast these good properties always go, I know we have to decide very fast. After the viewing, I was ready to take it, but my excitement sunk into the ground when I asked what she thought, and she said she didn't like it that much. She couldn't put her finger on it  or tell me exactly what made her not like it, just the general style she said, it's just a feeling. She did not feel unsafe or unwelcome in the house, she said it just did not feel like home. The house was not quirky and all of the rooms were good shapes and sizes, nothing felt old or outdated, it had a nice garden and well equipped kitchen,...

I found it very hard to deal with that, and finding a house started to feel a lot like playing the lottery of her feeling being just right. We got into a big argument and almost broke up.

Tomorrow, I will likely get a call back from the estate agent to put down a deposit to hold the house and ensure they stop viewings, if it has not already gone. We have spent the day together and discussed the house and the move, and I tried to make her see all the positives (for her as well as for me), but she is still unsure and said she would much prefer to keep looking until we find something she instantly likes. From our experience, I know that is very improbable to find whilst ticking our requirements at the same time, and I can see it taking many more months at the very least.

Am I the asshole for trying to push/convince her into moving into this house with me, and feeling very resentful about giving up this house on the basis of just a feeling that she has? Note she would be moving closer to where I live and giving up her current room in another town, and I would be paying for it until she finds a job nearby.

Should I put down a deposit or pass on this, knowing that a good opportunity like this may take a very long time to come along again?",False,no assholes here,8,28,0

And then he asked me to send him a selfie, he also specified he meant a ""normal selfie, not a naked one or anything"". I thought it was a bit weird but I did send him a funny, joking selfie with my tongue out. It's because I really don't like selfies, besides he has seen me on the pictures I've uploaded to tinder.

He insisted I send another, normal one. I said that I don't really like taking selfies and then changed a subject.

Next day we chatted a bit more and I have asked him something simple like ""what kind of music are you into"" to which he  gave me a response like ""everything really"" and then said: ""so am I gonna get another selfie?"".

&#x200B;

Now it annoyed me and I just ignored it and we talked a bit more about different subjects, but really it made me uncomfortable.

Basically the date we arranged never happened because I really didn't like how he was asking me for selfies even after I said I don't want to send them.

Now I know it's not  a big deal because it's just tinder and a guy I've never met.

dgoxlz,1570846214,AITA for bringing my best friend to a children's birthday party?,"Sara has been my best friend for 10+ yrs. Our sons are best friends. They live far so when they come over, they stay the night/weekend.

Kay & I met through mutual friends 4 yrs ago. We hit it off & consider her a best friend too. She lives nearby so we spend lots of time together. I've become friends w/ a lot of her friend group & really like them

I introduced Kay & Sara 3 yrs ago. We hung out together a lot, even went on vacation together. Kay sometimes mentioned things that bothered her about Sara. Despite her complaints, we always had fun together so I brushed it off. Sara & Kay are very different; Sara is very ""girly,"" loves makeup/fashion, Kay is more of a laidback tomboy.

In July, Kay told me she didnt like Sara. Considering this comes YEARS since theyve met, I asked what happened? Kay insisted me nothing, she said they were different people who didnt ""vibe"" w/ each other & would prefer to hang out w/ me alone from then on. I asked if Kay would talk to Sara & she said “no, there’s nothing to tell, she didnt do anything”

This put me in an awkward position. I want them both around. I explained this to Kay; she said we dont have to have the same friends so I tried to let it go. When Kay & I would have girls nights w/ friends, if I said that I wanted to invite Sara, Kay would get upset.

Everything came to a head last weekend. My son had his first flag football game. Sara & her son go to all of his sports games, so they were over. The problem was that I had planned to go to Kay’s nephews bday party the same day (I agreed before the game schedule came out). Sara is friendly/has met everyone that would be there

I txted Stacy (bday boy’s mom) to ask if they could come & said if they couldnt, my son & I would come over a different day to give him his presents. Stacy’s responded “dont be silly, of course they can”

Not wanting to blindside Kay, I texted her while on the way to let her know. I knew that Kay wasnt going to be thrilled but I thought she'd be fine. It wasnt her party. I thought that she’d get over it but she was pissed. She said “how could you?” “I knew you'd pull some shit like this” I said since it made her uncomfortable, we'd drop off the gifts & leave

When we got to Stacy’s, Kay was speeding off. Kay had made a scene at the party & screamed at Stacy for letting Sara come so she was outside crying. It seems that no one except me knew that Kay had an issue w/Sara. I felt terrible this happened at a 5 y/o’s party. Stacy urged us to stay, saying “this isnt Kay’s party, you’re all invited here” but I didnt want to cause any more trouble. We gave the bday boy his gifts & left

Things transpired after that, Kay's sister txted me saying ""ur so lucky I wasnt there"" (?) I tried to explain to Kay that I didnt think it’d be an issue being around Sara for 1hr at a child’s party. Kay said “I don’t care whose party it is or for how long, I dont want to be around anyone I dont like"" & has basically ended our friendship

dqkued,1572704643,AITA for reneging a contractor to save a significant amount of money?,"I honestly do feel really bad in this case, but I believe I’m justified. I’m also working on becoming less of a pushover because I've been one my whole life, and I know sometimes that makes people unhappy. But anyway, here’s the story:

I purchased a house last year and I knew I would need some trees cut down when I decided to buy it. I started the bidding process and gave contractor 1 a call, we'll call Mike, who I was referred to by the city arborist. I got a quote back from Mike that it would be $3000 and they were about two weeks out. 

So after not hearing from Mike for two weeks with no updates or email responses, I moved on to Ned. I figured maybe Mike was in over his head and just didn’t want to deal with me anymore. Ned was given two opportunities to come out and give me an estimate. He no showed both times so I moved on to Tony.

Tony was very timely, and by far the most professional of the contractors. He quoted me $3500 for the removal but then pointed out a lot of other things I hadn’t noticed, like a broken branch from a different tree overhanging my neighbors property, another dead tree (that I could cut down realistically,) dead branches overhanging the road, etc. He quoted me $7500 for the day to come remove two trees, prune the entire lot, and remove ANYTHING dead. I didn’t like the thought of that amount of money, but I wouldn’t have to worry about my backyard ever again. I negotiated down to $6750 cash, we shook on it, and Tony said he would be two weeks out.

Tony was supposed to come out this week but didn’t show, and I received an email from Mike saying that he didn’t forget about me and would like to come next week to do the tree. I told him that ship has sailed, I’ve moved on after seven weeks of no contact, and he offered to knock it back to $2600 as an apology. I told him I’d think about it, and called Tony with no answer. After doing some thinking and knowing that I would be reneging Tony, I told Mike that if they can do most of the work that Tony was going to do (explained in detail) for $3500 and show up this Tuesday next week, he had a deal. We agreed to it and I sent Tony an apology and that I would be going with Mike instead.

Tony texted me back and was not thrilled and said I wouldn't be getting the same quality going with Mike, but its more about the cost. It isn’t like it was a $500 or even $1000 difference, we’re talking $3250. We went back and forth for a while and I was very apologetic, and also let him know that he is still the most professional that I’ve dealt with but if he can’t compete on price then I need to move on.

The flip side to this is that doesn’t make me feel quite as bad is that if Tony would have just shown up this week like he said they would, I wouldn’t have known the difference. He would have been paid and I would have just told Mike that the work is already completed and they missed their chance.

At the beginning, she told me my husband would be invited - which was nice of her - we did hang out together and they know each other (taken vacations together, Friends Christmas’ every year, etc), but it’s a tiny guest list and I definitely understand if she couldn’t swing it. About a month ago, I caught up with her, and she began complaining about how she couldn’t get away with disinviting certain people from the guest list. Having experienced guest list drama myself, I told her to just let me know if she needed my partner’s spot and it’d be totally cool. She doesn’t take me up on it - so all was cool I guess.

Until...we get the invitation. It was a lovely piece of mail and elated, I tell my husband to book the tickets. After he did, I texted her all excited and told her that we got tickets to her wedding and we’re very excited. That’s when she texts back and asks if my husband was coming too (as if she was surprised by it) and how she is hoping someone backs out of the wedding so she can open up a spot for him.

Right now, I'm taking a summer class so I can skip alg.2 this year and take trig/precalc instead. School's starting soon, and my parents have been freaking out. Even though I'm nearly done with the course, they've been super paranoid that I'll fail and get kicked out of the summer class. 

Since it's an online school, I study everything at home, and at the speed of my choice, and it's been working out really well so far. However, my parents have been frequently calling every hour, sometimes multiple times an hour, to make sure that I'm doing work, and when they're constantly berating me on the phone for being slow or not sticking to schedules, it really disrupts my work. 

Speaking of schedules, they've been insisting that I make a standard schedule every day for every hour, but those never work for me. When I don't understand a concept or, on the flip side, realize something is much easier than it looks, the time required for me to complete units in the summer class varies. When I don't stick to the schedule, they get pissed and take away my phone and then yell at me over the home phone even more. 

They also don't expect me to take any free time until they get home from work (they're gone from 7am to 5pm)- and even after they get home, I still have to do work. I just want to finish stardust crusaders, goddamn it.  

Today, my dad got angry at me, because I completed less units than expected and took free time. He started lecturing me again, and I snapped and said that the calls and lectures weren't helping me.

In high school, like most of the people on the non-social media side of the internet, I was a shy, weird, awkward kid. I somehow managed to find my tribe and I ran with them throughout high school and after. These were my people. They accepted me, they were my first D&D group, my first regular gaming group. They visited me in the hospital when I was almost dead from dengue fever (I got better). But even then, not all was right in that house. I was disrespected a lot. I got left out of things. They were snippy and dismissive and always held it against me whenever I had to bow out of activities for things that would improve my life.

Enter the second year at the university I would eventually graduate from. In my second year, I'd decided to reverse what I'd done at the previous universities because I figured doing what I'd done then got me expelled twice, so maybe it would be best to take another tack. And it worked like gangbusters: I got my GPA up to about 1.5/1.75 (A/A-), joined school activities, got into student government, and even made friends. I could feel myself starting to drift away from my original friend group. I stopped responding to messages. I stopped going to D&D and game nights. Once, one of them violated bro code (""A bro should not be friends with a bro's ex"") and I didn't speak to them for a month and it seemed like none of them noticed or cared. I started to realize how embarrassing a lot of their behavior could be.

It came to a head later that year. We'd just finished our midterm exams, and it was my birthday, so my other friends and I decided to get together for a day trip to an amusement park out of town. I mentioned later on social media that I'd gotten sunburned and one of my old friends said ""This is what you get for not taking us."" I'd consciously made the decision to not take them along. First, logistics would be a nightmare (me, my friends from university and my driver filled my van to capacity). Second, it is really hard being the one common person between two groups of people who are total strangers to each other. Three, I had by that point long gotten tired of my old friends's antics.

April of the same year. I went to a birthday party with my old friends and decided to try making time for them . I asked if they were free the next week and they all said they were busy. I think nothing of it until a few months later in July. In July, I stumbled upon a Facebook post. A friend from that group had posted a photo album of pictures they'd taken at an amusement park. The same amusement park I went to with my other friends. From the weekend I asked if they were free. What upset me was the fact that they felt like they had to keep a secret. To deceive me. That was it. All I remember is cutting all ties and blocking them.

Now, 7 years later, they want to extend an olive branch. I shut them down.

So, she tried to remember anything i said or looked at in order to find something different to gift me, and settled on a Nintendo Switch Dock Cover, with an illuminated picture of a pikachu, which i looked at more than once at GameStop. 

Problem is, i have a special edition (Smash Bros.) version of the nintendo switch, so the dock cover would be pretty much useless for
me. I was looking for it bc i wanted to gift it to my brother, who has the generic switch dock and is overall more sympathetic to collecting plastic „garbage“.

In December we had a paper to turn in, and since one of them was a father recently (Let's call him Joe) and the other one is going trough a hard time (Let's call him Pete), I started doing the paper about 2 weeks before the time ends. I'd do one page, or one paragraph and send it to them by e-mail for them to see what was being made. Anyway this keeps going until Joe tells me by e-mail that I was being an individualist by doing all that by myself, and I was somewhat hurt by that because my intentions were to help them since we have so little time (work and school). I said it was not my intention, I just wanted to get work done since I knew they had less time then I did.

I also said again that I started doing the paper soon to avoid this, and that the dinner that they both had could wait one more week because the paper had a deadline, the dinner didn't.
Joe got pretty pissed at me because of what I said, and so did Pete.


This time has passed and things are now awkward because Joe still insists that I had no right in saying what I did, and I am starting to feel pretty bad... But I think true friends should share the good and the bad and I think it's what I did. Maybe I am just a freakin asshole... :| thoughts?

cwtwd0,1567041152,AITA For saying a baby cannot come on vacation?,"For the past two years, a group of friends and I have been planning a weeklong trip to Orlando to visit Disneyworld and Universal Studios in three weeks. The first rule we made when we started to plan this trip is that it would be childfree. The two people in our group that have children agreed that their children were young enough not to be traumatized from not going to Disney at 3 years old.

For personal reasons, one of my buddies had to drop out of the trip last minute. Since everything has been paid for, he said that if I could find someone to take his place he wouldn’t expect to be reimbursed in any way, except for sweets from Honeydukes and mouse ears.

I managed to find someone, but before I could say anything to the group. My girlfriend (hopefully soon to be fiancée, I plan to purpose on the trip) told me her sister wanted to take the empty spot. I asked how, because her sister just had a baby and at the time of the trip she will be 6 or 7 weeks. She said that her sister would just bring her daughter and we would make it work.

My girlfriend is a huge pushover when it comes to her sister and has never said no to her before.

I called her sister and tried to politely tell her that everyone going on this trip is either in their late 20’s or early to mid-’30s. She wouldn’t listen and started rambling about her daughter getting pictures with Mickey and Elsa (she also named her daughter Elsa btw) and how much fun she’ll have. I interrupted her and said that the trip was adults only and her newborn was not allowed. I then pointed out that a lot of the places we’ll be going to after the parks are adults only and no one would want to stay behind with her and the baby. Plus I don’t think an unvaccinated newborn should be taken to Disney.

I was called a dick and how dare I tell her how to parent her child and it was creepy that a bunch of adults wanted to go to Disney without children. The last thing I told her before I hung up was that the empty spot had already been taken, by someone, so sadly she cannot come, but we'll take plenty of pics in our coordinated disneybound outfits and wizard robes to show her later.  I think she cussed me out, before I ended the call.

My girlfriend thinks I was mean to her sister and said I should apologize for not giving her a chance to come on the trip. AITA?",False,not the asshole,2194,647,0

cumqkq,1566608188,AITA for not warning my mother her car was almost out of gas resulting in her ending up stranded on a highway?,"When I was a student I took a summer job in a factory out of town because I wanted to buy a car instead of borrowing my mother's one.

The factory worked 24/7 on shifts so, at the end of the interview they told me that they could hire me only if I could secure a private mean of transportation because the shifts were always beginning or ending at times when there were no buses.

I asked my parents if I could borrow one of their cars and, after a lot of discussion, my mother agreed to lend me hers on a couple conditions:

\- I should have given my work timetable at the beginning of each month

\- I couldn't use any car in the house if it wasn't for work.

Those conditions were reasonable because my mother was a freelance architect so she could take her appointments accordingly.

So I started working and in very little time I discovered that, even if I was getting 10 $ of gas every day and driving just 10 miles, the next day the car was out of gas. In the beginning I didn't care much, but after 20 days, before getting my first paycheck (they payed monthly), as I was pushing the car to the service station (my mother left so little gas that I couldn't get there) and getting late to work I decided it was time to confront her about it.

She got totally mad yelling that she was getting gas every day (I didn't believe her even for a second and at the end I had proof I was right). I even offered to pay for filling up so that we could refuel every day when we got home and pay our share... she was having none of it and got so mad that she tried to force me to quit my job by not lending me the car any more. Luckily it was over a weekend so I could have my father's one while he tried to talk some sense into her.

At the end she capitulated and, to my amazement, I was back to refueling every day.

On the last day before my paycheck, however, I had no more money so, as I noticed the tank was empty again I really had no other choice than hope I could make it to work and back... I managed it and left the car in front of home.

My mother went out and, as she said she was refueling every day I decided there was no need to warn her. Well... she ended up stranded on the highway after her first client and had to wait for 3 hours for a tow truck in a very hot summer afternoon.

She came home way late and I had never access to that car again. I had to resort to a wreck of a moped a friend lent me for the remaining 2 months of my contract (that even left me on foot a couple times).

AITA?

&#x200B;

TLDR: I got fed up for constantly refueling my mother's car that she was lending me as she used all the fuel so I didn't do it one day and she ended up out of gas on a highway.

c63kt0,1561629017,AITA for wanting to use the garage in a place i lease?,"Situation: i have the sole lease on a house. I leased it and then found two flatmates. They pay what i deemed to be market rent and i pay the leftover (i pay the most, recently absorbed a small rent increase as i didn't want to mess with their rent, and also have the master bedroom/ensuite - they share the main bathroom that i don't set foot in). We split utilities equally. The house has a single garage. When i moved in i didn't have a car and told them they could use it. No one was interested and it ended up being used for storage/crap/turned into a giant mess. The laundry is at the front of it and I occasionally used it to work out in but no one else used it for anything except laundry. 

A year later i bought a car. I spent some time cleaning up the garage and found a lot of stuff that somehow didn't belong to any of us, rubbish, etc. I stacked my boxes at the side of the garage so i could use it for my car. I didn't move anyone's things out of the garage except my own. One of my flatmates then stated unequivocally that they didn't want the garage to ever have a car in it, and that they wouldn't have moved in a year ago if the garage was being used to put a car in. I know they also want to store a motorbike they're going to get in the garage, but they claim the motorbike isn't the issue and that they think it's very unfair if the garage is used for a car because it takes up most of the garage space, preventing anyone else from using it for other things. The garage is wider than a single but much narrower than a double. From my perspective, no one has used it in a year and I am the sole leaseholder and since I bear the risks that come with that (eg i am locked in for a year at a time but my flatmates can leave with 1 month notice) i would like to use the parking space. The other flatmate doesn't really care at all. AITA?

ETA: i was always clear that if someone wanted to put a car in the garage they could, no one did (they own cars but park them on the street because they couldn't be bothered with the garage). I own all the appliances furniture TV PS4 etc in the living areas and have always said everyone can use these as they want.

bclzvi,1555122756,AITA: Dog Edition! AITA for Asking my Full-Time Working Roommate to Split Puppy Responsibilities?,"Okay. My roommate and I got two German Shepherd puppies about a month ago. They're absolutely precious, but since my roommate and I have VERY different schedules, we are struggling to potty-train them. I have asked her repeatedly to at least take them out before work and when she gets home. Her response was that when she gets home, she's tired, but she'll try to remember to take them out beforehand.

I finally snapped a bit today.

I am consistently the one caring for the dogs unless I ask her or remind her to, and this morning (afternoon) I got up to get ready for work and feed the dogs and take them out one more time before I left. Apparently, it was the first time they'd been out, because they had peed and pooped all over their crate (enough that I had no way of getting to work on time AND cleaning it up). I texted her and told her this, flipped their blanket over to cover the worst of the mess, and went to work (with pawprints of puppy poop on my ankles and knees from their jumping).

I came home, the puppies were out and about, and things seemed at least okay. I asked her if she had cleaned the crate when she came home (early, because she wasn't feeling well, but spent 2+ hours at the humane society, almost adopted another cat, and then came home and felt fine). She told me no, that she had just fed them and taken them outside.

This prompted an argument about our responsibilities. I am trying to find a part time job, and she works full-time, but says because she is bringing in the money right now, the puppies are exclusively my responsibility. She claims she paid for my dog - I asked her to pull $100 out of her bank to pay her cousin (whom we bought the puppies from) and in return, since that, with the rent, would be her $450 for the bills, I would pay the rest of the bills for the month. She is now convinced it was her $100 that went toward my puppy.

She wants to move out but barely pays attention to Seashell - even if she says she doesn't, she acts like she can treat a puppy like a cat (pay attention when it sounds like they're getting into trouble, chill otherwise, even if they're in another room). The other day, a bag of lily buds fell out of the bag I have on a bookshelf, and onto the floor. The puppies tore the bulbs apart, and could have eaten them all, which would have posed a serious health risk - she doesn't seem to mind, and turns the conversation back to me, and how I'm home all day, take classes online, and work one day a week (not by choice, mind you) - she says as such, my only responsibilities are the puppies and the dishes.

Help. I feel like whenever I criticize her, I'm the asshole, but it feels really unfair that I'm putting in all the effort to raise her dog, when she wants to move out within a year with said dog.

\-Jassy

&#x200B;

OBLIGATORY EDIT, because this was posted literally five minutes after we argued and I was furious:- We discussed all of this beforehand and she was fine with doing her share. It has been a spiral into her refusing to.

\- Their names are Salem and Seashell. They're the best girls and, while I admit I've had some shortcomings in caring for them too, they're my world.

\- The dogs go out multiple times a day, and I spend my entire day with them. It's not that they don't, it's that I can't convince *her* to spend time with them or care for them, even though one is 'her dog'. By all means, I have the time to take care of both of them, and I do. I feel it's unfair that because I'm home, it is therefore EXCLUSIVELY my job to care for them, even when she is home. But in the same vein, she gets offended when I offer to pay to buy the second puppy from her, and won't take any advice on how to raise her.

\- The dogs sleep with me at night, or in their crate one room over. They spend most of their day with me (outside, in the living room, in my office, etc., always playing or napping). They most certainly aren't starved for attention or affection. If I'm not actively doting over them, my boyfriend is.

\- Roommate was a bad term on my part. We aren't sharing a dorm room or anything - it's a four bedroom house. My church's parsonage, actually. Four bedrooms, a living and dining room, and a decent-sized fenced-in yard. They have plenty of room to run and play.

\- Money isn't a problem. We can afford to care for them. We split the bills 50/50 out of fairness; we're just far from any ATMs, and she works downtown where she can easily pull cash out. I get charged using other ATMs, and the closest bank of mine is 15+ minutes away by car. I don't drive.

\- I have had dogs before, especially this young. She has not. I am strict about it because she intends to move out. She has suicidal tendencies, and I'm worried that if something were to go wrong with her having the dog (ex: being evicted), she would not be able to handle it. I've been in that position before and *I* could hardly handle it.- I am experienced with dogs, and, again, have the time for them. It's a matter of responsibility and her claim that both dogs are exclusively mine to care for, even on her days off.  Essentially what I asked of her was to take them out before she went to work, and once when she got home.

\- I have two dogs of my own. Responsibility for them was never a problem because THEY ARE MY DOGS. Responsibility became a problem when *she* got a dog, even though she was working full time.  


FINAL EDIT, and hopefully a resolution!:  


My roommate and I were still not speaking, so I wrote down my ideal way of splitting it, which was as follows:  
9 AM, RM takes puppies out and feeds them. If they've messed in the crate, call me so I can take care of it and she can leave.  
12 PM, I take puppies out.  
3 PM, I take puppies out.

6 PM, I feed puppies and take them out.

9 PM, RM gets home. Takes puppies out.  
12 AM, I take puppies out one more time before bed.  


It turns out we were just terrible at communicating expectations, and she finds that perfectly acceptable, but somehow it got lost in translation until I actually wrote it down.  
Lesson learned: we will now write all conflicts down in order to make it easier for us to communicate (we work on two different wavelengths, basically).

So before this recent incident me and the SO already had some relationship trouble to say the least. 
When we met he was in the process of a divorce. Through a series of events and conversations he basically told me he was still in love with her. 
So the first year of our relationship I stayed with him despite for various reasons, mostly because he told me he was trying and wanted to get over her because he valued our relationship.

Eventually sleeping in bed next to someone I knew was in love with another woman every night got pretty mentally draining. I couldn’t handle it anymore and so I broke up with him after about a year. 
A few months after that he comes to me saying that he tried to get back together with his ex but she said no but that made him realize that it was never going to work with her and that they weren’t even good together etc....
eventually a few months later I decide to give him another chance. 
I tell him we aren’t going to date officially yet bc I was still very hurt over everything and I needed to see things really did change. He says ok and he’ll give me as much time as I need. We agree not to talk to/sleep with other people. 
Things started to get better and we were hanging out all the time/sleeping over every night by about mid November. 

Fast forward to last week when I borrow his laptop and look at his email (mostly out of sheer curiosity and nosiness) to find emails with some girl that spanned from the time he came to me and told me how sorry he was and how he was wrong and wanted to try again to late January.

I was pissed. I confronted him and he said he didn’t think it was a big deal at the time. Because we “weren’t dating.” But from my point of view if he said that he loved me and wanted to get back together than why would he feel the need to do that? 
We’ve been fighting about it ever since because although he acknowledges it’s wrong to some extent, we technically weren’t together so he doesn’t feel the same way about it that I do. But there’s also all the shit in our past....

Flash back to last Friday when I was supposed to get August rent from him. Friday morning, he’s gone, and so is his curve tv (his only possession worth anything). I find out from his friend that he’d lost my money at the beginning of July. On top of that, he also has a warrant for arrest in the next county for failing to appear on a felony charge from months ago (theft 1) which I knew nothing about. 

Flash to today, I owe unpaid July rent, late fee/his bounced check fees, plus August rent on the 1st - about $4k.

We want to stay on property for the convenience and full Disney experience. We go every 2-3 years and have done both on and off property hotels and prefer staying on.

Sis and BIL want to share a room with someone to cut costs, but their 1yo is a challenging sleeper who goes to bed pretty early. Whoever stayed with them would be pretty put out on a fun vacation by having to be super quiet in the room and potentially being woken up in the night if he's fussy, so no one is volunteering.

Sis and BIL are getting upset because they're saying they can't afford it if they have to pay for their own room on property. They're talking about not going because of it or at least staying at a different hotel off property. While we obviously want them to be able to go and would love for them to be able to stay with us, so we could spend more time together, if they can't make it work, they can't make it work.

Either way the problem is that they're already playing the guilt card. They don't want to feel isolated by either not going or not staying near everyone else, and it's our fault because we wouldn't share a room.

Some background all my life it’s just been my mom, brother and I as my dad is shit and so is most of his family as well as my moms family. I am 23F and my brother is 19M and is honestly spoiled. My mom with me was strict I couldn’t go out with friends until I was like 17 nor could I just take her car whenever etc. Like if I talked back etc I’d get my ass beat but my brother? He got to be out till late and take her car whenever when he was only 15/16. 

We grew up somewhat poor not gonna lie but you best believe he had an Xbox iPod etc where’s I was lucky if I could convince her to let me get something nice. I had to work for all my shit where’s he got to sit on his ass eat and play Xbox all day. Anyway me and my mom do not get along at all (surprise surprise), I moved to a city 45 mins away and rarely talk to her or my brother. Before I moved he got this shitty Toyota Corolla from our step dad and my mom basically guilt tripped me/forced me to put his car under my insurance as well as under my name cause if he got insurance on his own or put it under his name it’d be hella expensive because he’s young etc. 

He has been on it for a year now & it’s been hell, I have to constantly remind him to pay me the $45 for his part or I literally have to threaten taking him off to pay me. I’m honestly getting tired of it, and recently I’ve found out he’s smoking weed which is whatever I do 2 but he’s being dumb about it. For example he’s always snap chatting him smoking or like the bag of weed or recently HIM SMOKING AND DRIVING AROUND. Oh and of course my mom doesn’t care nor says anything to him, but it’s one thing if he did it at home etc but now he’s risking my rate going up as well as me getting in trouble because the car is under my name!!!

After finding this out I told him that after this next month he is off my insurance I don’t care how much he whines or begs because I’ve had enough, I also told him he better have money ready to register the car in his name as I am taking my name off and cancelling the plates. Of course this did not go over well, he blew up my phone with calls and texts. Calling me a bitch, stuck up, that I must hate him, he doesn’t need me he’s grown, all the way to fake crying and begging me to please keep it in my name and the insurance because he doesn’t have money. But yet he’s got money for weed, going out to eat, going out with friends etc!?!? Yeah right. 

Now my mom is also blowing up my phone pleading on my brothers behalf/ guilt tripping me again. At this point I’m ready to just put him back on so I don’t have to deal with my phone being blown up.

At one point he mentioned an African place he really loved and I told him it was good but I preferred another place because I knew the owner/chef, who was originally from that country. I expressed my opinion that the second place had an authentic flavor because the owner/chef grew up eating and creating dishes from her homeland, and cooked them in a manner very close to the traditional way that I recalled when I visited her country not too long ago. 

My friend got offended and asked, “So if the cook isn’t from the original country then you think it’s not authentic? You do realize that most line cooks at any ethnic restaurant are most likely not from that country right?”

I said, “No, what I said was that I preferred the second place because the chef knows the authentic flavor of her regional cuisine. Don’t you think it’s better for a chef to actually have spent time in the country trying to learn the specific flavors of that area’s dishes?”

He disagreed and said that when he was done with culinary school, his goal was to specialize in northern Chinese cuisine. He’s not from the country and has never been there before. I asked him if he planned on traveling there in the future to sample the food and he said it wasn’t a priority for him. I replied that it should be if he wanted to consider himself an authentic chef of that specific regional food.

My best friend and roommate (we’ll call her A) was dating a guy (we’ll call him B) for around eight months. My roommates and I loved B. He was and still is one of our best friends. However, she broke up with him earlier this year after hanging out with her ex-boyfriend, feeling stressed over the distance (like an hour apart from one another, nothing extreme), and said she just wanted to be single. 

Immediately after A and B broke up, A started seeing another boy (we’ll call him C). C was at our house every day over this summer. Essentially he was our 5th roommate. We mentioned to her that it was a little suspect that she instantly starting spending every waking moment (literally) with C after breaking up with B (who she said she was going to marry) in order to be single. 

Fast forward to a music festival this summer. B and his sister camped with our group. A and B acted like they were dating the entire time. Holding hands, skipping and shit, the whole nine yards. Let it be known that C was also at this music festival. A would go off and spend time with C as well. I’m not sure if they also held hands and skipped but I don’t doubt it because keep in mind, C has been living with us for over a month now. 

A couple weeks ago, A told me she wanted to end things with C in order to get back together with B. I advised her to think carefully about what she was going to do because it isn’t fair to B and C for her to flip flop. She ended things with C, but wanted to maintain a friendship since they work together. 

B comes and stays the weekend with us last week. Things are great. They’re acting like a couple and what not, good shit. We even went to B’s huge ass family gathering. They also booked a trip to Europe together (leaving in a couple months.) So to everyone else except for A apparently, it seems like they’re dating. 

This week, however, A has been going to C’s house. She has spent the past two or three nights at his house, went to a show with him last night, and has continued to talk to him (very frequently) all of which she has kept from B. 

Last night, I text A to see if she wanted to grab a beer, and she said she was out with C. I just asked if B was like... okay with that? To which she responded that “B and I aren’t dating. I didn’t tell him, but it isn’t his business. Nothing is happening lmao.” 

This entire situation makes me uncomfortable. I’ve been good about minding my own business, but it’s at the point where she can’t keep both of them at arm’s reach with no repercussions.

I'm not sure if it's due to brain damage or the fact that everyone makes excuses/let's him do whatever he wants, but he's incredibly selfish and only thinks about himself and is rude and mean.  

He often says things way below the belt.  For example, in undergrad up to my junior year I was in the elementary education program.  At the end of my junior year, I found out I wasn't going to be let into the next level due to missing a class (I was student teaching and missed a day because I had hand, foot and mouth).  Anyway, my brother was comparing me to my aunt at one point and said ""Oh, and neither of you are teachers."" At that point what happened was very fresh and very hurtful and he didn't care that he hurt me.  

So today was Easter and I saw my brother.  He made another very cruel remark for no reason.  At this point I had had it, the relationship with my brother was one sided and negative.  I told my parents I was done with my brother and my reasoning.  They said I was asking for the comment because I wasn't careful about trying not to annoy my brother.  They said that I was being dramatic and we don't cut out family, especially my brother who has a brain injury.  

There's no evidence that the injury touched any part of the brain that has anything to do with judgement, emotion, or anything like that.  I feel that I'm right for cutting him off, at least for a while.  Am I the Asshole?",False,not the asshole,3,15,0
bebv8o,1555528867,AITA for calling my cousin a lazy mooch?,"My cousin Lindsay (not her real name) got married a year ago to a guy named Brian (not his real name). Brian is an amazing guy, he makes friends really easily and everyone is just drawn to him wherever he goes, he’s amazing to my cousin and she admits she feels like a queen when she’s with him. Brian has a job that pays well into the 6 figure category and can easily provide for both of them and always does his fair share of housework. After they had been married for a few months she began nagging Brian to agree for her to stay at home full-time to be a housewife, that way he could be the breadwinner while she makes sure all the tasks at home are being competed. Brian was ok with it and at first everything was going fine. 

Recently it has become apparent to everyone in the family that Lindsay does absolutely nothing when she’s at home all day. She doesn’t clean/tidy *anything*, never cooks, does grocery shopping, or any laundry. Essentially anything that needs to be done at home as well as earning a steady income falls on Brian’s shoulders and we all feel that’s incredibly unfair. We’ve all been to their house and witnessed firsthand that Lindsay just can’t be bothered to do much of anything, when we ask what she does all day she admits to spending her time shopping online, watching tv, or going out with friends (which she’s entitled to do, but she should also help keep the house tidy since that’s why she’s not going to work). We asked her why she wasn’t doing more around the house and she angrily told us we’re sexist for expecting her to do the housework because she’s a female. For the record, that is absolutely not the reason we expect her to do the housework. 

Some of the family (including myself) have heard them arguing. Brian tells her that if she wants to be a housewife she has to actually do some work around the house and that it’s unfair for him to earn 100% of the income and do 100% of the work at home too. Once again, she just called him sexist and stomped out. 

Yesterday I was at their house and the conversation between Lindsay and I got heated after she began complaining about Brian. I stuck up for him and said all his requests for her to pitch in more around the house were reasonable and that right now he’s pulling 100% of the weight both at work and at home. Lindsay did not take kindly to that comment. She starting screaming at me and calling me sexist, a bigot, as well as a laundry list of other insults. At this point I snapped at her and said “You’re lucky Brian loves you, if I were him I would’ve kicked your lazy, mooching behind to the curb weeks ago.” With that I left and I have no intention of talking to her for the foreseeable future.

He also made a new friend at hospital. 17 y.o boy. That boy lives closer to me, so when my son stayed with me(weekends), they’d hang out at my house. They were really close. 

Then they started fighting about something, I still don’t know what, and my son was incredibly stressed. I could hear him crying in his room, I tried to talk to him but he refused to. Me and his dad talked, we decided it would be best if he spent more time at his home, so he wouldn’t have to see his friend. 

It was fine for first two weeks, then he said he wanted to see his friend. We said it would be better if they didn’t see each other. He got really upset over that, but we told him that our decision was final. He started throwing tantrum and breaking stuff in his room. Next day he snuck out to see him and we caught him. We grounded him and took his electronics. He went mad at that point, he broke literally everything in his room.


I was just so damn tired, I couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even talk to him. I told his dad that if he needed anything he could contact my parents and left. I went to another city and stayed there. I had 0 contact with my son or his dad. I got back after a month. My son just looked at me and acted like he didn’t see me.

So I became the responsible sibling out of 3. My older brother only cares for himself and I take care of my little sister and me, taking both parenting roles. My sister is only a freshman in high school so I’m a bit protective and careful. She doesn’t hang around the best of crowds. But ever since she was little she would never tell anyone where is she is going we’ve gotten so worried and called the cops multiple times. We’ve had talks to her about telling us where she is going and what she is doing. 

So I finally snapped whenever she started disappearing everyday and coming home at 9-10 pm without a text of where she was or what she was doing. I would call her and no answer. I talked to her about this and told her that if she doesn’t at least tell me where she is or what she is doing then she’ll have to be grounded. She questioned why she had to listen to me and I explained to her all the concerns and dangers and I thought this was finally the end to this. She continued to disappear and over the weekend she was gone no word, no permission. I called her phone no answer. Whenever she came back I told her she’s not allowed to to hang out with friends for 2 weeks. We argued. She tried to go that same day to hang out I stopped her we argued and she pushed her way out. I tried controlling my emotions but I was angry. I drove to several locations I know she would be at and made her come home and told her she needed to listen to me and she was grounded. 

So AITA for telling my sister what to do? I do admit I am protective of her but we’ve had talks about this many many times.

But recently, John was hospitalized. He’s like 8. Hospitalized for dehydration. Now, I just do not see how a mother could allow her child to be dehydrated. They’re not without water or food, they’re middle class. They have it. She just never pushed him to drink water or eat. She claims he refused to eat, but every other time she’s said that, it was because she didn’t make him what he wanted to eat. He would come over to my bf’s house and eat no problem. Because his aunt made him what he wanted to eat. 

This kid also shits himself because he doesn’t want to leave his xbox. He is always jumping and running around with people in bed. Never takes his own dishes to the sink, and if you tell him to he goes crying to mom and she tells us to not yell at him. Irks me. 

The older one, Jack, (12 ish) he sits on the couch all day.  Wipes his boogers on the wall. Gets pissy if you tell him not to, puts his fists up like he’ll punch you. Pisses me straight off.

Last week, she asked me to attend the baptism of her newborn son. It's her first child, I don't (yet) have children myself.

The baptism takes place the first week of July, but we already planned a week of holiday in Germany. We booked everything, including hotel, tickets for an eSports event and some other activities. This put us back a few hundred of freedom dollars per person, most of it is non-refundable.

My sister is a bit upset and wants us to attend, because she ""asked in time"". We also missed the gender reveal party because of earlier made plans (yawn) and this would be a second ""big moment"" we would be missing.

It started when I came out of school and went to the train station to take my train home. I sat down on a bench and next to me there were two teenagers (12-15 years old, one girl and one boy).

I overheard them talking to each other about how they need to come up with a plan since they ran away from home. They seemed really hysterical and were constantly talking about how the police is looking for them at where they're planning on going.

One thing to add is that they said they were in foster care and they couldn't go back to their families.

I was kind of shocked in the moment and I didn't know what to do, so I thought about it for some time and decided to call the police. When our train arrived they got arrested immediately.

I am really uncertain about my decision, so I made some pro's and con's.

Pro:
- Their foster homes will be investigated and possibly more people can be helped
- Taking care of yourself at that age is really difficult and they seemed immature
- Who knows what would've happened to them if they ran away

Con:
- I'm not sure about the outcome of the police investigation
- It wasn't my business to get involved
- I may have ruined their lives by doing this

I’m honestly surprised she is single but I’m paranoid it won’t be that way for long.

I’ve been planning on moving for a while now and in August, I plan to actually fly out to the area I’m going to be moving too. A weird coincidence, but she actually lives out there. 

Now I have already made it clear to her that I’m definitely crushing on her. She accepted my feelings but hasn’t returned any because we don’t really know each other. I can respect that reason because it makes legitimate sense. 

Anyways, a few days pass and I just cave by letting this girl know that I want to a reasonable chance. I want to actually meet her in August when I fly down there and I want to go out on a date with her.

When I say chance, I mean that I want her to reject every other guy until I get a chance to go on a date with her. Which is roughly 40 days from now. 

She actually agreed to us meeting up and even agreed to going a date to see how compatible we are. Unfortunately for me, she didn’t say that she would give me the “chance” I’m looking for. That means if she falls for someone in that timeframe, my chance of hooking up with her is gone. It sucks and I would like a to avoid it, but if that happens, then it happens.

Erica and Carly decided last summer that Meg’s personality is unbearable to be around (too loud, obnoxious, smothering) plus, according to them, Meg just goes with whichever of her friends is most appealing per evening/weekend. They were convinced that if they ghosted Meg, Meg would forget about them. They were wrong and now here we are. 

Everything Erica and Carly think about Meg is opposite of what I think about her. Meg is fun, caring, adventurous, etc. So I told Erica and Carly that I still wanted to be friends with her, which is fine with them “as long as I don’t gossip about them to Meg.” 

I went along with these terms for almost a year now. I am finding it harder and harder to stick to them because Meg has been more of a friend to me than Erica and Carly. Meg has wanted to hang out with me despite the hour or more drive. When my dog died last month, she was there for me to talk it out.

Being a family man isn't always easy but I've dealt with it. Sometimes I just need a break. I found that break, accidentally, in the form of prescription medicine (codeine). I took one of these a few times a week and it gave me this nice warm high and I have never felt so chill. Anyway I went through about 60 of these we stashed away over the years.

My wife was okay with that kinda. Anyway I ran out of them and knew it was a bad thing to get hooked on. Haven't had one in a few months.

Normal people who want this feeling just drink alcohol. I drink socially but I don't wanna drink 5 beers a night to get this same feeling when I just need to chill out.

* My cousin's wedding will literally be 10 minutes down the road from our home, while the brother's wedding is over an hour drive away
* This is her brother's second marriage, and to a woman he was dating for a few weeks before proposing to, who he started dating only a relatively short time after getting divorced, all of those feel (to me) like reasons not to go

When she brought it up today on the phone, I said no again, but this time she got mad about it.  She said she doesn’t want to get shafted by paying more than me or vise versa, which I understand. She also is mad I don’t trust her with the combined account.  I told her I would think about it. 

She called back later, and I suggested we just split in the expenses up, like I’ll pay groceries and utilities, she pays rent and WiFi. We would keep track of what we spent. Whoever pays less will just transfer the other the difference at the end of the month. She thought that was too much work.  

Next I suggested a joint credit card to pay the expenses.  At the end of the month, we would each pay half of the of the card bill.  She accepted that, but she was still mad because I don’t trust her.

dyrojk,1574201105,AITA for disowning my maid of honor after her behavior at my wedding?,"I \[32F\] got married last month and it was almost perfect....except for my maid of honor \[28F\] ""Carly."" For context, we've been friends 9 years, she has a domineering personality (I'm more quiet), she recently started making tons of money ($170K), and she complains when other people can't afford to go to nice places she wants.

Carly and her husband eloped last year (only family was invited to the ceremony) and had a reception at a nice restaurant 6 months later. We paid $1600 on travel to be there & $300 on registry gifts because they're our best friends, even though the costs were too much for our current budget (we figured it was worth it for a once-in-a-lifetime event for our favorite people).

Bachelorette party - Carly kept dragging bridesmaids into political arguments and privately joked to me about how silly it was about how religious one girl is. During brunch, Carly got in a huge fight with her mom over the phone (she stepped outside then came back and loudly ranted to any girl who would listen). I tried ending the conversation but Carly doesn't like being told to wait to talk about something and in the past has accused me of being unsupportive when I asked if we could talk about something later.

Wedding weekend: I rented a big house for all the girls & hubby rented a house for the guys but Carly & her husband decided they'd rather stay in a nicer hotel nearby. Morning of, Carly was late for make-up and asked me if the artist could also do her hair (we were on a tight schedule). My other bridesmaids got Starbucks for everyone and cooked breakfast and cleaned up the kitchen while Carly walked around on her phone and interrupted the make-up artist to ask when they could start on her.

Carly eventually convinced the make-up artist to do her hair, but then she was PISSED about the ""crooked braid"" and I heard her complaining 3 different times about what a bad job they did when were busy trying to get ready in the bridal suite (she also complained to my husband later that night). Lastly, we received their gift 2 weeks after the wedding: a set of nice wine glasses worth $80. We never asked for wine glasses because we have 30 already. I would've preferred a thoughtful card at that point.

Now that the wedding's over, I just want to move on with my life. She's not the kind of person who accepts constructive criticism (turns into a barrage of ""it didn't happen that way"" or ""you're wrong because X""), so I don't feel like exerting the mental energy & emotional labor required to reason with someone who'll blame me (that's how our conflicts have gone over in the past, but I'm an introvert with a few close friends so I never felt like it was worth the possibility of her nuking our friendship).

ausm1m,1551140934,AITA for breaking up with my fiancé during his deployment?,"We are both in our early twenties. I have been dating my fiancé (now ex, I guess) for 1.5 years. At first, our relationship was great. I thought I was so lucky to find someone like him. We moved in together after 5 months of dating. 

He then became more controlling and posessive. He would do crazy shit like smash my phone against the wall, lock me in the house, flush my birth control, etc. He even became physically abusive, e.g restrain me, choke me, slap me, etc. 

I was scared to leave him. But due to my low self esteem I thought he was the best I could do. That is why I accepted his proposal. He basically said “If you dont marry me you’re gonna end up dying alone.”

About 2 weeks later, he got deployed. His deployment is 3 months in length. Currently, we are precisely at the midway point. With him gone, I realized that I was much happier being alone than being with him. I started going out with friends again and having a life outside of work. I felt more happy and live than I had in months.

After a lengthy emotional talk with my family, I decided to break my engagement with my fiancé. 

We had been chatting via Skype and messenger for the past month pretty regularly. He gets angry if I don’t text him everyday. The last few days, I haven’t texted him at all.

Then, this evening, I decided to send tje following text:

> Hey. Sorry for not messaging you more this past week. I’m been really busy with work. I’ve also been thinking about us and I must admit I’ve had my doubts about our future together. 

>To be honest, I do not think we are right for each other. I’ve been thinking about all the times you’ve disrespected me, treated me like crap, not listening to what I wanted. I don’t need that. Life is too short to stay in a relationship that makes me cry everyday. 

>I’m moving my things out of the apartment tomorrow. You don’t have to worry about me, I’ll be fine on my own. I’m sorry if this was sudden. I think you are a great person and I’m sure you’ll meet a woman who you can respect and who can respect you. If you treat her better than you treated me, I’m sure she’ll stay. 

>I love you and I will be your friend always,
T

I thought it was a pretty nice, respectful message. But then he responded and went mental, calling me a whore and a liar and threatening to “hunt” me down when he came back. 

I told one of my friends about this whole thing and she was shocked that I ended my engagement via text. She said it was a “dick move” and that I should at least call him or break up with him in person. I told her the reasons why I could not do that, but still she said he deserved better and that he’s probably heartbroken right now. She really made me feel like shit.

c81z0o,1562024855,AITA for wanting my boyfriend to wake up earlier,"I know that’s a bad title but it’s the gist of it. 

Anyway, backstory: I (24F) just moved hundreds of miles to be with my boyfriend (25M). We’ve been together for three years and two of those years were long distance. That finally ended about a month ago. 

My boyfriend works night shift (11pm-8am) and has for about a year now, so I don’t usually get to see him during the day. When we were long distance it was worse since there would be days when I either don’t talk to him at all or for only about an hour. I wouldn’t get off work until he already went to work and he would be asleep by the time I got up the next day. 

Most days he’ll go to bed around 9/10am and sleep till about 8pm. I usually wake up around that time so most nights we don’t even sleep in our bed together. I go in and wake him up around 7pm but he’ll either lay in bed for another hour or take a really long shower. Either way I can expect to see him about an hour or two after I wake him up. By that time he has to leave for work. 

Ever since I moved here I feel like I haven’t spent any time with him. I’ve been painting and working on our new house every single day but he’ll be sleeping cause he worked all night. Which I don’t blame him for at all I just feel like I’m doing so much and I’m exhausted by the time he gets up at 9pm. I don’t think he needs to be sleeping 10-12 hours a day and I’ll tell him but he still does. It upsets me because I feel like I uprooted my life for him and he can’t wake up a couple hours earlier to even just have dinner with me. He’s also the only person I know in this area besides a couple of his friends and family. 

AITA for getting upset that he sleeps so much and I want him to wake up a few hours earlier so we can actually spend time together?

UPDATE: well thanks for the (sort of) positive feedback. I guess I should’ve added that I work as a server and will be at work till 2-3am some nights. Anyway I talked with my boyfriend and we agreed I’ll stop being a needy bitch and he’ll wake up a little earlier on his off days so we can spend time together.

Four years ago the courts stripped all rights away from my ex and gave me full custody. She was to get her act together and get her rights reinstated. Meaning a job, housing, and stop using drugs and alcohol. None of these she accomplished, then to top it all off she was sent to prison, and was just recently released. My ex has wrote many of letters to our child and at first she was eager to write back. Now she doesn't want to reply at all, her mother has now been out of jail for over a month and not once has even attempted to call, or reach out in any way. Until the other night when this happened.

She gets on FB and messages me with ""why is the child not writing back""? I responded with, cause she does not know what to say, my child then stated ""I can't even remember the last time I seen her, or what she looks like"". Furthermore my child stated ""she says in her letters that she loves me and misses me, but she doesn't call or show up to any of my events."" My daughter would ask me all the time why her mom doesn't come, and frankly I cant really answer, I did send out the invitation. Even well before I knew she got locked up.

I wouldn't watch these shows by myself, just to illustrate the ""shared"" component.

She's taken on a habit of reading ahead about shows, usually ones based on true stories. So we might be watching a series about a real life crime story and she gets nervous about the suspense and reads ahead about the whole case and who did what. She doesn't do anything annoying or spoil the story for me, she simply knows what will happen in the story and obviously there's less suspense and she's not surprised. This diminishes my experience because we can't ""share"" in surprises etc. since she already knows what will happen (no ""OMG BOB WAS THE KILLER"", or ""Who do you think did it?"").

Tonight after the first episode of a new series she started reading about the story. I asked her to stop reading about it and I explained my position. She was on her phone doing her inquisitive face and I knew she was reading about the story and she denied it.

  So some backstory, I’ve been living with my girl for 5 years, I love her to death but the past year we’ve hit a rough spot.

I think she understood it like it was my way of saying I didn’t want her to go out because she got super offended. Started ranting about me holding her back from doing the things she wants to do, being controlling, not supporting her gym aspirations and so forth, so instead of me trying to counter her points or give examples of how the thing she says is not true I just got a few clothes together and hobbled my way back to my parents house.

Let me preface this by saying I have done a ton of work on my anxiety this year alone. My girlfriend has always been very supportive, and works on herself constantly.  My biggest phobia is flying. Last time I tried getting on a plane was 8 years ago. I panicked and pushed through people to get off of it (while on Xanax). Haven’t wanted to do it again since. My girlfriend LOVES to travel.

We talked about it and here are some reasons I say no: It’s a one hour flight, and then four hour flight to get there. I have sedatives I can take, but i would have to take quite a bit and I’m scared of drugging myself back to back for each flight.  I also don’t want to embarrass myself in front of her mom by being an anxious mess, as we are still establishing a relationship. I also don’t really want to spend over 1500$ as I make less than her, and we also have events coming up we need to save for.  She expressed last night being bummed I won’t be there, and would like to try a smaller flight soon to see how I do. Though I would like to travel at some point within the states, and I want to make my gf happy, it’s honestly really not that important to me to travel out of country, or to work on this phobia right now as I have plenty other smaller, more pertinent ones to tackle first.

ckr0cp,1564678528,WIBTA if I refused to help my boyfriend with rent after I move out and back home?,"Hi everyone,

Two years ago my long distance boyfriend and I moved in to a studio flat together as we were both going to school in the same area (he was finishing his degree, I had moved from the US to the UK to do my masters). We agreed to split rent, food, and bills 50/50 during that time and didn’t have any problems handling it. About 8 months ago we both finished our respective degrees, he started a recruiting job in the city while I struggled to find a job as I needed a work visa.

As my loan money for living expenses started to run out, we decided he would cover our rent, and I would handle food, bills, and both our gym costs, as well doing the cooking, cleaning, laundry and general chores as I was unemployed and home and he was making a salary. When my visa ran out, I moved back home for a bit earlier this year and continued to send him money to cover the flat bills and both our gym membership each month which was also agreed upon.

Well here’s where the WIBTA comes in:

This summer I came back to visit for a bit, so we went back to our previous agreement of previous bills and food and household chores. My job situation is looking up, but it would be a position back in the US so I would not be physically living in essentially his flat (he took on the lease on his own when I left). Obviously, I am excited to actually start making a decent salary and we started talking about it. He made the comment that I would finally be able to pay 50/50 again, so he would be able to save more instead of having almost nothing left in his account two days before pay day every month. I went a little quiet and didn’t agree but didn’t say anything to him either. I told him I would be paying my own bills back home and that my student loan payments would also start coming out, most likely my parents would also want me to contribute to the house more while I’m living at home so it would be complicated.

Here’s where he kinda rubbed me the wrong way. He proceeded to then whip out his calculator, add up the total of what he projects my expenses to be and compare it to an expected salary, then showed it to me saying “you’d have more than enough to split rent too.” I didn’t argue with him because I still feel guilty and selfish I was essentially living rent free even though we had our agreement, but it just feels weird to be paying rent in a place I don’t live anymore.

I’m trying to decide if that’s unreasonable or not? I was going to continue to send him money for bills, gym membership and of course a little bit more every month, but I don’t feel like I should be paying half of the rent for a place I don’t live in anymore?

So WIBTA if I didn’t agree to this?

&#x200B;

EDIT: To answer some questions, we mutually agreed I would continue to pay bills as I'm in a financial position to do so. What he's talking about now is paying rent and bills 50/50 together.

 My friend had surgery in the middle of December on her foot. She is not just in a walking boot. Since her surgery, she has been on two different opiods for pain, claiming her foot still hurts. She is the kind of person that overdramatizes everything, so me and my friends suspect she is not in that much pain and get high off of them, but she denies this. 
 Since we have gotten back to school from winter break, she will ask me to do a few favors for her because her foot hurts. When she was still on crutches, I had no problem occasionally bring her food or picking up a few things for her when I was out. I knew she was the kind of person to abuse this power, but I felt bad. 
 Once she was allowed to walk with her boot, the favors didn't stop pouring in. She would ask me to go to get her groceries occasionally and said she couldn't come because she was in pain and would actually go with her friends to get her nails done or go hang out with other people. She hardly asks other friends to help her. 
 I finally lost it when, as pretty as this sounds, she left a bunch of junk food at my apartment and when she could come pick it up. I told her I would be home at 1. She said she would pick it up at 3. Great. I took a nap and woke up at 2:30 to texts and calls from my friend. She said she was outside and NEEDED her food. Junk food. I texted her back letting her know that I was asleep and she said she was coming at 3. All she wanted to know was when I would bring her her food as if this was my fault. I told her when I walk my dog around 9:30/10, I would bring it by. She told me she would be asleep by then and I apologized and told her I can't leave because I have three tests the next day that I am studying for, but she can come get them. No response. I texted her at 9:30 and never got a reply. 
 Fast forward to 11pm. I'm at the library and my friend says shes coming home from a friend and NEEDS her food because she had a rough day. I simply told her I'm sorry, but you told me you would be asleep and I have to go back to studying. She continued to text me that I should come home to get her food. I stopped replying. 
 I know this all sounds really stupid, but stay with me. They next day, after pulling an all nighter, I have a different friend over and my friend calls me and asks for me to bring her her food. I told her that I am cooking dinner with a friend, but she is more than welcome to come by and get them. She told me she can't walk. Her foot hurts. I told her she would have to wait then. She then told me ""fine. I guess I'll take more pain meds and walk over""
 I lost it when she said that. While I should have called her to tell her this or spoke to her in person, I was pissed. I told her that ""I am sorry her foot hurts, but it's been almost two months since her surgery and this is getting out of hand. People learn to adapt after surgery. I had major surgery on my foot and I learned to deal with it. You refuse to use crutches, so you have been relying on me too much. While I want to help you because you're one of my best friends, you have other people around you and I don't appreciate being used and lied to. (I listed a few occasions she has lied while asking me for favors.)"" 
 I also told her that I did not appreciate the way she treated me in the fall when she had mono. She would always claim that I would call her and wake her up and that she needed to be selfish and sleep all the time. I get it. I've had mono. But she would send me messages on Snapchat at 2am and I would reply and then she would tell at me for waking her up. And there was one time my dog was injured under me bed and I needed help. She lives the closest out of all of my friends, so I called her at 8:30am on a school day. I got yelled at for that. 
 I'm ranting now, but I am almost done. To all of this, she told me that her doctor told her not to walk (but she refuses to use crutches) and that as her friend, she thought I would help her more, but I am not a good friend. 
 I want to help her. I really do. But being lied to and pushed around when she lays in bed and smokes and hangs out with other people makes it really hard. I am the one who always gets called a bad friend. She has excuses for all of her actions. 
 So, am I the asshole for not really wanting to help her anymore?

Edit: she's currently at a party right now, so I'm starting to have even less sympathy for her. ",1518238902.0,not the asshole,33,13,0
d0lw0r,1567800683,AITA for wanting my girlfriend not to invite people over because of my OCD?,"First, a little bit of background. I struggled with OCD throughout high school. It eventually got really bad I had no support from my parents and they wanted me to either magically ""get over it"" or to take pills which I was completely adamant to. Anyway, many therapy sessions later, and moving out on my own helped me in improving my condition drastically. However, I still have certain aspects of it that I retain and not wanting people to come to my home is one of them.

&#x200B;

Here's when my girlfriend comes into the picture. We've been together for about 2 years and I've always been open about my OCD and she has been overall very understanding and compliant with it. When I moved in with her, we had to share an apartment with a roommate. It was difficult for me but we didn't have too many issues because I didn't see the apartment and the things in it as ""mine"" so I never felt the need to keep everything clean and untouched, plus I knew it was a temporary situation so it was manageable.

&#x200B;

Eventually, we moved out on our own in an amazing apartment that I love and I definitely feel like home in. Shortly after, however, my girlfriend had to go back to our hometown to work for a couple of months so I've been living there alone throughout that time. Now it's time for her to move back in. I've told her that it's very important for me to keep the apartment clean and orderly which she isn't used to but I managed to convince her that it would not be that difficult and she's agreed to try. Another very important thing for me was that we never invite guests because of how much anxiety and stress this would cause me. Her parents aren't aware of my condition and she claims that they would never understand it and basically hate me if we told them they can't come over because I don't want them to. (Mind you, I don't want my own parents to come over either.) Now her dad insists on helping her with moving her things back in and bringing her whole family to come see the apartment because they've ""never seen it in person"" and maybe even spending the night there. I was terrified when I heard that and we got into a huge fight over it. I understand that she can't tell her parents not to come in and I will have to endure it but we got into other issues. She claims that she never thought I wouldn't want to have people over ever, only not often. Furthermore, she is upset that I'm being disrespectful to her parents and seeing them as ""dirty"" even though I've explained that it's not personal at all. She claimed that she never thought I would be so extreme and that when we discussed it earlier, she thought I wouldn't be asking for so much. Overall, it came down to her finding me too demanding and suffocating. I was really surprised because, again, we had discussed these things before we moved there and she said that it would not be a problem. Am I being too demanding or is it reasonable to ask her not to do things that I know cause me stress and anxiety?",False,asshole,21,122,1

There was an odd number of people who confirmed, so we were looking for someone to fill the void. 

A mutual friend of ours wanted to go, but she's not in a position to financially. Privately, I told her that I'd pay for the room because I knew that she has had a shit year, and this would be something to look forward to. She agreed. We hugged. 

Fast forward to today, registration started at noon, and there's a high demand for not only a room, but a nice room. I was able to get through, scored an ocean side balcony room, and everything looks good. I messaged Friend A, and turns out she wasn't able to get through. I know she was up all night working, so either she slept in, or there were just too many people. We both tried to book another room, but even the basic staterooms were full.  

I don't think our Mutual Friend really cared about the conference side of things, as we only talked about the cruise side. Friend A was looking forward to both.

Anyways my husband and I have been together for 3 years, married for only 5 months. When I first met him we were still coworkers and his wife was already very, very sick (intestinal cancer). She wasn’t very lucid at the time so while I struck up a good friendship with my husband (her then husband) I never got to meet her or converse with her in any way. She passed away ~2 months after I first met my now husband. 

We stayed good friends and I supported him through this time (platonically only) until we started dating roughly a year after his wife passed away. We both felt a lot of guilt for finding love after loss so quickly but we were inseparable and still are. 

Recently, I got an email from his dead ex’s best friend who says she has a letter for me from his ex-wife. She says it’s for me only bc his ex had wanted him to move on after her so she wrote this letter to any woman who he’d marry after her. Her best friend said the letter is very sweet and full of nice memories and good things. But the thing is I really don’t want to accept it or read it. The thought of it makes me nauseous even though I have nothing against his ex.

d21n9z,1568084061,AITA for Disliking my Grandpa?,"Background: I am 16, my mother just found her biological father last year, and he's finally shown up to meet her and my family.

My mother was adopted and always struggled to find family. She's spent most of her life and almost all of mine searching for people she was related to. She found her birth mother before I was born, but her birth mom refused to tell her who the birth father was and left some vague hints for us to go by after she passed.

After a DNA search, we found her birth father almost a year ago. It was really hard for me to process as a 15 year old that assumed my mom had no biological family alive or known. They had the parent-child reunion and things seemed fine.  I always felt a little off being around him, especially when he said he has ""no regrets in his life"", but I did my best to shrug it off. *He is family after all.* but a few days into his stay, he began to show more of his ""true colors"".   
He repeated his stories, which wasn't bad, except for the fact the details were beginning to change bit by bit. The first time he told his story he said he never knew my mom's birth mother was pregnant, but later said he might've known. 

We moved past the fact he was lying just to him getting into fights with my dad about things they were having casual conversation about. My dad is a very level headed person and the first time my grandpa got shitty, my dad talked things out and was willing to make amends. It happened a second time. My dad had to leave his own house because of my entitled grandpa. Later when my grandpa went back to his hotel, my dad finally went off about how he was disrespected by basically a stranger and about how he abandoned my mother and how it led up to her having to suffer with the pain of being  adopted. And I agree with my dad 100% on this. But at the same time I know to an extent it does hurt my mother that I'm not fond of her dad.

So we booked tickets for an almost full flight and the only row with 2 seats near each other had someone that already booked the seat in the middle. I figured they did this because they didn't want anyone booking next to them, but they were the only seats left so I booked the window for myself and the aisle seat for my girlfriend. 


When we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he’s very proud of it. Then he asked if I could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. I was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. I honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. So we denied him, and he just comes at us with, ""you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?"" I answered, ""no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.""

They have asked me to move in with them, only asking me to pay $200 a month to help them out, which is very cheap! I'm over there a lot as it is. They make about $1800 and their bills total out to $2000 so they keep getting behind. The wife isn't able to work much because of unexpected medical problems that came up recently, which is part of why they're behind on bills. It's starting to make my male friend depressed because he's extremely stressed about money and starting to get overworked. I've had to pay some of their bills already. 

I brought up the idea of moving out to my parents (I'm 21) and they kinda got a bit upset because I watch my little brother (10 y/o) 3-4 times a week, depending on their work schedule. But they live in a nice neighborhood with a nice alarm system, and he's 10, he should be fine right? That's their only problem with me moving out as far as I know. They are charging me $400 in rent a month but are putting that money aside for me for when I'm ready for college again. They can afford the babysitter as well if they hire one. Also I've moved out before for about a year and a half (moved away for a girl, didnt work out, came back). But that whole time, my 10 year old brother stayed at home those 3-4 days a week by himself then, so I dont understand what's different now. I feel as if they dont want me to move out.

Concert in March, so she bought the ticket via giving C the money so she could keep the ticket until they met up for the concert (it's in London and we're hella far away) fast forward to early april, she has 2 jobs and university to contend with (which she does somehow because I'm assuming she's a wizard) she tells her other friend, L, that she probably wasn't going to be able to make it because of work and other commitments so she floated the idea that she might want to sell the ticket to make some extra money (key word: might) fast forward a week later and my girlfriend gets messages from both C and L, C asks why she would want to send the ticket to L, this greatly confuses her until she looks at the message from L.

L said to C that she already decided to sell the ticket and found someone else to sell it so ""depending on the price"". She gets a bit upset, saying something along the lines ""well fuck man guess i dont have a choice since you decided to sell them without me"" (which L alleges that C messaged L about whether or not she was coming, which smells like BS because theres no reason it would come up in conversation that she was thinking of not going unless she brought it up on purpose).

C was asking my girlfriend how she went about this, my girlfriend tells her that she hasn't actually said she isn't going to, at which she asked C to send her the tickets because she is actually fairly upset at this point that L kind of went behind her back to try and get this ticket.

Introducing M, the prospective buyer and L's friend, M seems genuine that they want to buy the ticket at the actual price she bought it, even though my girlfriend wanted to make a profit on the ticket (which was clearly communicated to L), so M is willing to buy at full price, but the issue is that L went behind her back to M without consulting her in the first place about it.

So now my girlfriend feels really awkward because L already agreed a price with M and now my girlfriend has to say no to M, (she's an awkward creature and I can see how much this hurts, she's also Indian and would probably kill someone over a penny (jokes)), since the concert is in less than a week, she was pretty confident in getting a tidy profit from the tickets as scarcity and demand both increase (its looking like over £100 in just profit it's not scalping, she only bought one ticket and originally wanted to go).

These are electrified rails using electromagnets to drive the train forward, and a deep drop between the platflorm and the track area is absolutely covered in warning signs.

I simply let the doors close between and gave her a ""shit happens"" look while she was able to somehow glare death rays and convey utter shock at me as the train pulled away.

My knee-jerk reaction was to blame her for using her phone during precarious moments, but that is 100% from a place of self preservation, not critical thinking. Was I involved enough that I was obliged to stay at least until we flagged down a transit employee? I know that'd be the kind thing to do, and something I'd more likely do these days, but that doesn't mean not doing it is necessarily the wrong thing.

bkqbgb,1557006959,AITA for wanting to DNA test our hypothetical future children?,"Context: I've been dating my girlfriend for close to 5 months now, and things are going really well. We've agreed to take things slow and not rush into anything. But we both feel like ""this could be the one"", and have casually started discussing stuff like marriage, kids etc.

Let me preface this by saying that I have no reason at all to doubt her specifically. She's an amazing person with a lot of integrity and moral character. I trust her more than any other person in this world.

That said, I'm a poster child for [Popper's theory of falsifiability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/12/14/theres-no-such-thing-as-proof-in-the-scientific-world-theres-only-evidence/#67910d395392). Ie, *""Nothing is for certain. There are only things that have not been falsified yet.""* Heck, I could even be a [Brain-in-a-Vat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat) for all I know.

With that in mind, I half-jokingly mentioned to my girlfriend that in the hypothetical future, once we have kids, I will get them DNA tested just to be (more) sure that I'm the father. This thought came into my mind, because of a story I had seen about a father who found out 20 years later that [his 3 children were actually not his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm_PXqtElnY). I have no reason to suspect that my girlfriend would do anything like that, but I would be absolutely devastated if that happened to me, and I figured there's no harm in getting the kids tested. We had already agreed on signing a prenup (her idea), and I figured this is no different.

Anyway, she was very upset when she heard about this, and started crying. From her perspective, me getting our kids tested shows a lack of trust in her, and is an insult to her. She wants our relationship to be based on trust and faith, and getting the kids tested would run contrary to all that. I tried explaining my perspective above to her, and that it has nothing to do with her personally. But that didn't change her feelings.

We've eventually patched things over - I agreed to not get our kids DNA tested. I trust her enough, and if it means so much to her, I don't mind taking that (miniscule) risk for her happiness.

That said, I'm curious to hear how other people think about this issue. Is getting the kids DNA tested a reasonable thing to do? Or is it an asshole move?

-------------- Edit -------------

Haha, wow, thanks for tearing me a new one guys. I showed this thread to my girlfriend, and we both had a good laugh over it. I appreciate the feedback - I know I have a very weird way of looking at the world, and it helps me to get more feedback on how my thoughts can be perceived by others.

To respond to a few of the comments: 

- No, I'm not going to secretly get my kids tested. I said I wouldn't do it, and I pride myself on my integrity
- I can understand why someone may think that I'm a jealous/controlling person. But I'm not. My previous ex even got upset with me because she thought my lack of jealousy is a sign of my not caring about her. I would never want to restrict my loved one's ability to live life to the fullest. I would suggest exercising a little more caution before making assumptions about others :)
- I do trust my girlfriend more than I trust any other person in the world. But then again, I did work in risk management for a company whose motto is *""Only the Paranoid Survive""*, so maybe it has rubbed off on me ;)",1557017216.0,asshole,521,287,1

bl6a5a,1557109254,AITA for being sensitive about my husband's ex?,"My husband and I have been together for 3 years and married for 5 months. He was dating someone before me and they broke up shortly before we met and started dating. They were together around 2.5 years, they lived together, and he's said that he wanted to marry her until she cheated on him. 

When we first started seeing each other he would talk about her constantly, including intimate details of their sex life. It made me really uncomfortable and I almost didn't even see him again after our first date. A few weeks into hanging out I told him that if he was going to talk about her so much then I wasn't interested in seeing him anymore. He pretty much stopped talking about her altogether after that.

Around 8-10 months into our relationship we were looking for a house to rent. I can't remember which one of us found the house originally but we found one and moved in. A few weeks later I was driving home and saw his ex in the front yard of the house across from ours. Turns out that was the house my husband and her shared before they broke up. I'll be honest and say I absolutely flipped out and yelled at him. Had I known we would be neighbors with the woman he wanted to marry in the house that they shared just 1 year previous to that moment, I would have insisted we pick a different house. I could tell he would stare at the house when she had people over or when she was outside. It was just uncomfortable. She also tried contacting him during this time. He didn't tell me about it right away. I found out several months later. He said he ignored her and I didn't press it further. 

We have since moved from that house. Tonight the XBOX reset and he had to put in all of the info again. He was putting in the wifi and couldnt remember the password. The first thing he said was, ""is it (random password)?"" I said no and told him what it was but he got really flustered and awkward. He said, ""oh I just said random words that came to my head."" I could tell he was lying because he's horrible at it. I questioned him and he admitted that it was the ex's wifi password. I said that I found it weird that was the first thing that came to his mind when he hadn't used that password in over 3 years and we have had the same one for 3 years. He got really angry and called me an asshole and said I was being really mean about it. I probably wouldnt have said anything if it weren't for his weird behavior and lying about the whole thing. 

I do trust him. He is a wonderful person who I love very much. However, when it comes to this one girl I am really insecure. It seems every time she comes up it's something shady and he gets really weird about it. 

ETA: I forgot that I said this as I was writing the post but I want an honest judgement. After he admitted that he lied about the wifi thing, I said ""if you've cheated on me, I will eventually find out."" Which made him understandably angry. And I definitely feel like TA for saying that but not for being insecure about it in general.

cf985p,1563551511,AITA for not defending my friend from a creep?,"Sorry in advance if my story is overlong:

&#x200B;

My SO and I took some friends to a house party that turned into a bar crawl. We're all twenty-somethings and used to this sort of event, and I happened to be the only guy in our group.

Now one of my friends is conventionally very pretty, and tends to attract a lot of male attention on nights out. This night was no exception, and soon an acquaintance of ours, a guy who had hosted the initial house party, was deep in his cups and had his sights set on my friend.

It was pretty obvious to anyone looking that my friend did not appreciate this guy's advances. He wasn't spouting pickup lines or saying anything lewd, but the way he was laser-focused on a girl he barely knew made it pretty clear what his intentions were.

For better or worse, my friend is shy and never explicitly told this guy to leave her alone, just shot a pleading look to our friends, who whisked her away further from the bar. The guy was either too drunk or oblivious to get the hint though, and followed her around the (rather small) venue. There was a lot of ""buy you a drink?"" and ""let's do shots!"", all rather innocent on their own, but again painfully obvious what he really wanted.

For my part, I sat back and watched. If the guy had, say, asked my friend to sit on his face, or called her an uptight bitch for snubbing him, or heaven forbid grabbed her, I’d have jumped in. But he never did any of those, just creeped on my friend for an obnoxiously long time, while she did nothing to make it explicit she wanted to be left alone. After 1/2 hour or so, the guy stumbled off to try his luck elsewhere.

At night’s end, I figured I'd done ""my job"" as the only man in our group: I'd kept an eye out, the guy had never ""crossed the line"" so to speak, and all my friends were going home safe. But once my SO and I were alone, she started laying into me: Didn't you see the way that guy was harassing our friend? Why didn't you stop him, etc.

I replied that the guy's advances were certainly unwanted and persistent to the point of creepiness, but he was never insulting, obscene, or physical with our friend. Who was I to step in if she wasn't willing to tell him no herself? I wasn’t some wannabe “white knight” after all.

Now I understand why a woman might not tell a man ""no"" outright. Some men react badly, even violently, to rejection. But we were in a very safe space: in public, surrounded by friends. I'm also a decently large dude and well versed in mixed martial arts; I could have handled the guy easily if he'd escalated things, and we all knew it.

In the end, my SO and I agreed to disagree. She thought I should have stepped in and told the guy off. I thought it wasn't my place unless his behavior had been beyond the pale. Was I wrong to expect some agency from my friend before defending her myself?

8y7lhl,1531379935,AITA for lashing out at a customer service rep and slandering a company online?,"Now, this is a story of how i helped my grandmother with her tv. My grandmother has had Directv since 2005, we have been loyal, she's always made the payments on time, been loyal since the start.

Now, here's what happened. We have At&t for our internet and phone, and Directv for our TV. Now, they had been pushing her and pushing her to bundle everything to save money. She was skeptical at first, but eventually called to set it up.


Now, keep in mind, my mom lives with her. She's the one who helped set up the internet and phone for my grandmother, so the bill was in her name. While DirecTV was in my grandmother's name.

So, to bundle, you actually have to have the newer boxes, we've pretty much had the same boxes since the beginning. We never upgraded to a new box (one that had DVR, OnDemand movies, and everything else).


So, then a technician came out and set all our new equipment up. Now, i hate to be a jerk, but this guy was WAY too old to do his job. He seemed very senile, we asked some basic questions about the features, and the man seemed to have to idea what he was talking about. He also marked one of the remotes,the one for the tv in my bedroom, he labeled it for the ""Bathroom"", which we don't even have a tv in there.


Now, my mom is the one who did most of the talking to him. She knows more about this then my grandmother. Now, she told him countless times that we wanted to switch the Directv account to my mom's name, that way everything else would be bundled. However, this dumbass didn't transfer it over or change the name of the account. He just opened a brand new account in Mom's name. The old man had no idea what he was doing.


So, the end of the month came, and we got our bill. Or rather 2 bills. One in my grandma's name for her old equipment (which he hauled away) and for the new equipment in my mom's name. That's right, we were getting charged TWICE.


Tell me, does this make sense to you? Does it? Do you understand our problem?


Good, that means you have a higher I.Q. then the doofuses who work Directv's customer service. But apparently, Directv can't understand that. We spent hours on the phone trying to explain this to them.


So, we didn't know what to do. We did close the account in my grandma's name, we tried to anyway, but when we did...somehow our tv got shut off. We called back, and they said they also cancelled the one in mom's name because they thought it was ""fraudulent"", because the bank card we used (in my grandma's name) was the same one on file for the old one.


Yeah, they had a hard time understanding that too.


Also, funnily enough, the bill was NEVER bundled. We still got different bills for internet and tv. Not only that, but we were also getting charged MORE. Originally, it was over 150 dollars for both Phone, Tv and internet seperately (combined together), but if it was bundled, it would only cost $130 for all (according to the guy who asked us to bundle). But, our first Directv bill was for 300 DOLLARS!


And a month later, our tv was shut off. Somehow the old account was still open. It was just a big mess. It was because we weren't paying is what customer service said. We had been paying, just somehow on the old account. We tried to explain we didn't have the old equipment anymore, the whole dog and pony show again. They said they were ""Not responsible for damage to their equipment"". And guess what?!, We didn't pay the bill, we didn't have the money. We called and told them this, they said it would be fine and gave us a later date. Not likely, because they went into her bank account and took EVERY DIME she had out of the bank. Without warning. We didn't even have auto-pay enabled.


So, i had to call customer service again. I was fed up with it, and i kind of just wanted to lash out at anyone. I admit it. Now, the customer service lady was Indian. The call center was in India. ANd i had a hard time understanding her. She told us that we hadn't been paying, and to send back our equipment and it would cost somewhere like 600 dollars to get it cut back on. I just started yelling at her. One thing i'm not proud of is i made fun of her ethnicity.


Here's how the end of that conversation went, after she told me that.


""Wait a minute, God Damn it. Are you in India right now?""


She was quiet for a bit. ""Umm, yes sir but i don't see...""


I shouted and interupted her ""Well i want to talk to someone in the God damn united states, instead of you scamming sons of bitches! Cause we have been sending payment after payment to you rag-headed motherfuckers!""


She was completely flustered, i could tell ""Sir, please calm down, there's no need for that.""


""Oh, shut up!. I want to talk to somebody who can speak english, i don't need to talk to you sons of bitches!"" and i hung up.


Keep in mind, i am ashamed of how i acted with that woman. There was no need to call her racial slurs, but i was so fed up with that company.

Cecelia also just got out of a relationship that she was in for about a year. 

Before I met Cecelia, my brother told me, ""I wouldn't be able to handle Cecelia's crazy, it's probably somewhat related to why she's no longer in the relationship she just got out of.""

The same thing happened the fourth night but at some point my brother came out and saw that her and I were cuddled up on the couch (completely clothed mind you). I saw him because I really wasn't able to sleep much, and I heard him come out.

I decided to tell my brother that I had a thing for Cecelia, because I didn't want it to come and bite me in the ass.

\> Moving date - July 24

It takes 2 days to drive from San Diego, CA to central TX

Months ago, I told my parents (my dad works the con with me) that I may not afford to be able to buy my plane ticket and go to SD, essentially forfeiting the con for good because I didn't work last year b/c of family death. They offered to pay for my plane ticket there if I drove back with them (they drove to SD a week early.) I thought about it and agreed, I'd only be gone a week but I could make it work (5 days of con + 2 days driving). My mom has a little bit of a history of trying to manipulate me and what I do with promises of money and then revealing strings attached. Anyway.

Fast forward to the day I arrive in SD, Wed. That night in the hotel, after the con, they ask me if my BF (who I live with in TX), can pick me up from San Antonio. Actually, it was couched like this.

""Is (BF) picking you up from San Antonio?""

me, confused: ""what are you talking about? He's not picking me up""

and they pretended that they had ""talked to me about it before"" which NEVER happened, because I would have actually asked my BF, and not promised he could do something without talking to him first.

""ok that works because you can just drop me off in austin on the way to houston""

""we can do that""

I privately told my BF what happened, he felt like my parents had no respect for his time and simply saw him as an extension of me.

Them deciding to stop in SA was a NEW plan and they tried to LIE to me and say it wasn't. Now they're pissed that my dad has to stop in SA, drive me to Austin, and then drive back to SA, after driving 8 hours from NM to San Antonio TX.

They're now accusing my boyfriend of being disrespectful, I told them it's not his job to be ready at my every beck and call, and they originally told me they would drop me off in my city, and my mom made sure to hold her phone up in my line of site and text her friend about how she ""won't be happy"" with my BF if he doesn't come pick me up.

Even so she will put her food on one of the shelves that’s not hers to make for room for herself. This didn’t brother me a lot at first until she would start to put uncovered food on top of my things and push my things to the side. On several occasions I would open the fridge to have her stuff fall out which would make a huge mess. She also will constantly leave garbage in the fridge if something runs out. she’ll just leave it in the fridge so she won’t have to put it in HER garbage. which she keeps in her room because she doesn’t want to use or take out the communal one.

czpi86,1567624977,AITA for making a ‘racist comment’?,"The title sounds so stupid but hear me out. 

Also, I’m using a throwaway as I don’t want this to be part of my actual account.

So me and my friend are both Asian. However, we both lived in different environments and he was constantly surrounded by white people whereas I was constantly surrounded by asians.


My friend has other friends who are white and they have names like ‘George’ or ‘Tom’ or ‘Harold’ and I always joked about how his friends  have “white people names.”


I was basically teasing him about how his friends have basic names.

I literally did not mean it to be offensive at all, I just joked as the names were very basic and he kinda snapped at me telling me that I have a basic Asian name and I should “stop being racist.”

Of course he must’ve been pissed off at my constant teasing but I was quite shocked.

I found it so hypocritical of him to say that because once when we were at a shop and the cashier did not give the correct change to him and when we walked out, he called the cashier a “stupid Indian f*ck” (not in front of the cashiers face of course) and I was quite shocked at him for even saying such a thing.

So for him to call me out on being racist about making some stupid joke pissed me off. 


I honestly don’t believe in that reverse racism bs and I believe that anyone can be a victim of racism, weather they are white, black whatever.

But I’m starting to think that maybe my joke was a form of casual racism? I honestly didn’t mean it to be offensive at all and I just thought it was funny and stupid. 

I thought my joke about having basic white names would be like people joking about names like “Chad” or “Karen.”

Being told to stop being racist was a shock for me and now I think that maybe I really was out of line. 

If I was then I’m really sorry and I’ll have to revaluate my morals.






Edit: 
So I just want to say thank you to the people who bothered responding with actual reasoning to their decision.

Also, the reason I mentioned the incident about the cashier was not to point out every mistake my friend has made to make myself feel better or to defend my actions but to point out the hypocrisy- I found it annoying how he said something as terrible as that but then told me to stop being racist and it’s a reoccurring problem because it’s not the first time he had said something like that, yet he suddenly acted like a human rights activist when I said something. 

It just irked me because he acted like he has never said anything wrong in his life and he was targeting me and at that point, I had honestly believed I had done nothing wrong so it upset me.

As for the joke I made about ‘white people names’, the reason I even made such a stupid joke to begin with was because of course, we are Asian so we are not use to seeing English names and seeing such generic/basic names just made me want to take the piss out my friend, just to annoy him a little because he only hung out with white people and he didn’t have many Asian or non white friends. I now realise the joke was dry and insensitive and though some people dismissed it as being minor, others felt offended by it, so I’m sorry if that was you. 


I am against racism. I try my best to be understanding of other races/cultures etc and I have been exposed to other races through out my life. The people I go to school with come from all sorts of ethnic backgrounds. I just rarely see white people in my area. I did not have any bad intentions when joking around because I thought, ‘they are just names, why would people get offended over that?’

I thought that names like ‘Karen’ was often used as jokes by everyone, so I joked about the ‘white people names’ in that sort of context because the entire ‘stereotype’ about Karen is how she’s a middle aged white woman who doesn’t vaccinate her kids and wants to see your manager and I just associated my friends’ white friends as that, but only to annoy him.



However, it was insensitive of me and pretty damn stupid.
I learnt that words can be hurtful and casual racism should not be dismissed so I’ll keep that in mind and I deeply apologise once again to those who have been offended. 


I believe that I am not racist. I already come from a specific background that is discriminated and I would never want someone to feel that way. That doesn’t excuse the dumb stuff I’ve said though, so I’ll try working on myself.

I’ll try better in the future to be careful with what I say and to regard thought into what a person may feel about my words.

 Last week end, some friends and I went out bar hopping and met up with another one of my friends (I'll call her Alexis). Alexis had her friend (I'll call him Dylan) dd for her. Alexis is a lightweight. She will be drunk out of her mind on half a mixer and a shot, which is what she had that night. I've met Dylan a bunch of times before. He's a good dude, I enjoyed his company. After that night, we all parted ways with me dropping off most of my friends at their houses and Dylan taking Alexis home (which he has done a couple times before). 
      
They stopped at a fast food place which is normal for them to do. While there, Alexis said that wanted to lay down, so Dylan took her to his house. I'm not sure why they went to his house and not hers but I suspect she asked to go to his house because she still lives with her parents and didn't want to come home drunk. She also lives about 30 minutes away and he lives about 10 minutes away. 

They get to his house and she lays down and asks him to cuddle (keep in mind she is still drunk at this point, not as badly as before but still drunk) and she then initiates sex. 

They end up having sex that night. She was drunk and he was perfectly sober. She was not on birth control and he did not have any condoms but they still had sex. 

She told me this the next day and I asked her if she has taken Plan B or anything. She said no and said she didn't think she had to.

Situation:

I'm planning to travel to my grandparents' for Christmas this year. It's 2.5 hour drive.

I don't have a car, as I live within walking/biking distance of my work, and for everything else, there's Uber. I am planning to take the bus.

They live way out in the boonies where there aren't cabs or uber at the best of times, let alone on Dec 24. The nearest bus station is a half hour drive (each way.)

They are pushing me to take a rideshare with my mother, which it drops me off at a McDonalds closer to their homes.

I do not want to take a rideshare. Sitting for more than an hour is uncomfortable due to an old hip injury. The idea of sitting in a stranger's car, unknown safety record, unknown car condition, with other strangers and my mother for 2-3 hours on the highway is horrifying to me.

My grandparents are in their 80s, but still drive 8 hours a week to visit my uncle in another city. As well, there will be about 10 other people there who can drive, and several other cars. And, some of the family will be traveling through the town with the bus station, and I am happy to time my arrival or wait around so they can pick me up there.

I suspect I may BTA because I may just be being stubborn and this would inconvenience someone else.

Our offices are about 6 miles from our home. So for the past few months we’ve been driving to work together. Sometimes she will walk to her office from mine or I’ll drop her off. 

I go to the gym before or after work throughout the week. I usually have to cut my gym sessions short because I have to drive back home in the morning to pick her up, or if it’s after work I have to drop her off at our house before I head to the gym. Both of these instances add about a half hour or more to my time, hence why I have to cut my gym time short. 

Also, sometimes she will want to get coffee in the morning before work. She will sometimes get upset if we don’t have the time for it. For example, today she said she wanted coffee in the morning before work so I told her to get up earlier if she wants it. I ended up getting out of bed before her and we we’re both ready around the same time but it still did not leave enough time to get her the coffee. So she was upset at me that I wasn’t fully ready before her ( I was just grabbing a bag of chips for lunch). I've told her many times if she want's coffee we need to get up 20 minutes earlier, and that I will follow her lead when she get's up. She still gets up at the regular time despite what I've said.

d16oly,1567918187,AITA For refusing to be the Maid of Honour at an “old friends” wedding?,"For context: I’ve always had major trouble socializing and making friends. Grew up in a small town where everyone knew everyone, and let’s just say I was never really popular.

I became friends with this girl that I’ll call Abbie, because I was admittedly more afraid of being by myself for all my school years than I was anything else. Problem is, I was so scared of having no friends, I made a really bad choice with Abbie. 
She wasn’t exactly the worst person, but she had her own shit to deal with, and unfortunately was a very toxic person.

Abbie would make it impossible for me to say no to her, and if I did anything to upset her, she’d go dark on me, refuse to speak to me for hours or days. Every little thing that made her upset was suddenly my fault- she never said that to me, but she certainly projected her shit onto me and made me feel guilty for every misdeed against her.

It got really bad in the last year I knew her. My mental health was at an all time low, I was more depressed than I’d ever been, but my friendship with Abbie had conditioned me to feel guilty for even feeling this way. My brain had translated it to ‘How dare you feel depressed, Abbie has it so much worse and you need to give up everything for her, everything to make her feel better’.

I felt like I couldn’t think or speak or do anything around her, and anytime I tried to get some space, she’d come back and make things worse.
Anything that was wrong with her was my fault, and I had to always be there for her to make her feel better and make her life better- when she never did the same for me vice versa.

I moved away from that small town and I was doing so much better- I made some real friendships and got into a really good mental state.
A year or so after I left my hometown, Abbie made a surprise visit!
We had exchanged maybe a dozen words over the past year, and I got no warning from her about her visit.

In just a week, I went from my best mental state back to the constant feelings of guilt and exhaustion from having to bend over backwards to move my entire life around her.


Her visit was a year and a half ago- and again, we lost all contact. 
But a week or so ago, she hit me up saying that I was her best friend in the world, and that she wanted to to travel (what would be across the country) to be her maid of honour.

I’m trying to help my own mental state after hitting a bump in the road, and I’m sorta getting back on my feet these days. Not only do I not have the money to make the trip, but I know in all certainty that if I ever saw her again, it would really, really destroy me.

Our entire relationship has always been incredibly toxic, and I don’t want to be used as a crutch or an outlet for her shit anymore.
But again, I feel incredibly overwhelmed and guilty just at the thought of saying no.

TL;DR: Toxic friend wants me as her maid of honour, I feel too guilty to say no to her.

UPDATE: Thanks for everyone’s piece. I told her I couldn’t do it, and I got a pretty short message in reply that basically said ‘thanks for telling me’.
No word other than that, so she’s gone dark on me again.

cpd26p,1565619869,AITA for telling my mom she can't decide whether I can go on a trip?,"
A bit of background first:
I'm a 22F currently in university in a mainland European country and living with my mother and my 35 year old sister.

My mom is kind of a helicopter mom and wouldn't let me do most things outside of the house until late in my teenage years. 

Now that I'm in university there are still things I'm not allowed to do (like sleeping in my boyfriend's house without a ""good reason"" or coming home after 11pm)

Most importantly, everytime I want to make a trip in which I would either travel alone (even inside my own country) or travel with a friend she hates and thinks is a bad influence despite never meeting her or go to certain locations ; I have to argue with her for days before she lets me go. This means that I have developed a lot of anxiety at the prospect of telling her that I want to go somewhere.

So when my aforementioned friend announced that she was planning a trip to London I was very hesitant. On the one hand, I really really wanted to go to London but on the other hand I was sure my mom would be extremely reticent. My boyfriend was very motivated to go and motivated me too, so after we planned everything I told my mom about it.

I told her I was planning to go and with whom, she proceeded to tell me no because my ""promiscuous"" friend was the one organizing it and that she would make me go to ~bad places~ (Which ofc wasn't something that she would do).

At this point I snapped because of the pent up anxiety and the fact that I was tired of always having to fight and I told her that she doesn't get to decide whether I go or not because I am an adult.

Then it all went to shit. She said I was ungrateful and that since I claim to be an adult I can leave but she won't financially support me anymore. She then told me that I had to throw away everything I took home from the trip (including my clothes and my bag) because she heard about bed bugs infestations in youth hotels. She also said she would call a lawyer to ask how not to be responsible for me anymore and that she would kick me out if she has to. She also made nonsensical justifications for her reticence like: ""I'm going to be neck deep in debt of something happens to you"" (not true since my country's ductal security convers all medical expenses in foreign countries) and ""other people your age can go because they have two parents that work and drive cars but you can't because you only have one parent that doesn't work and doesn't have a driver's license"". She said other hurtful things to me and that I had to move out the day I graduate.

I feel like she was very egoistical in her reasoning but I also feel extremely guilty for what happened and I should have just accepted the no she told me or not have brought up the subject at all because I just lost all my financial support over something so small.

We plan to completely half the bills when we officially move in.

Last week, he asked me to send him £200 to help with get by with fuel and bills, so I sent it to him. I had explicitly said that I didn't want to send him money for him to waste it because we are both pretty broke and are saving up to sort out the house. Yesterday, he messaged me saying ""won't be able to talk for a while, going to the escape room with \[friend\]"". I messaged back asking how they could afford to go considering they are both broke, and he replied saying ""I used the money you sent me for us both"". This really annoyed me because I had specifically asked him not to spend it on something he didn't need as I don't feel it's my place to pay for that, especially when I have missed out on things this week because I sent him that money. And, to be honest, I was annoyed because we had planned to go to the escape room he went to, and this isn't the first time he has done something with his friends rather than me, which doesn't bother me if it isn't something like an escape room, which you can only do once.

I responded to him telling him to send me the full £200 back, which he then told me he wouldn't be able to make it to pay day without it, and so I told him it wasn't my issue anymore because he chose to spend the money not wisely. I thought it was justified to do this because he had spent the money on leisure whilst I have missed out on things with my friends so that we can save and just pay bills. He sent me the money back and it's been slightly awkward since. I spoke to my friend about it, and she said I was overreacting and if anything, I should've just asked him to send me the money that it cost for him to go to the escape room with.

bsadvd,1558657647,AITA for asking for an apology after how I felt treated in an argument?,"I had a really close friend that ended our friendship shortly after an argument we had a while back. For context, we were really close friends however we've had our fair share of heated arguments. One night, I was upset about the lack of friends I had in college (I went upstate for college and had plenty of friends back at home).

The next morning, she messaged me asking if I was alright and I ended up going on a tirade. Since we go shopping every Saturday, I met her at her room and while walking to her car I asked for her input regarding my situation and whether she thought something was wrong with me. She asked why I wanted to hear her opinion on the topic, and I responded by telling her that she was my friend and I valued her input. We went in circles for a bit where she wanted to be absolutely sure I wanted to hear her opinion and ended up telling me that I probably don't want to recognize what the problem is so I have no right to complain about it. I became very upset at that comment and stayed quiet in the car.

When we got to our first stop (we went to a couple of stores while shopping) she asked what was bothering me and I passive-aggressively responded with ""I shouldn't complain about my problems, remember?"". She became upset at that and told me that she didn't do anything to deserve that kind of treatment from me and we ended up staying quiet the entire time we were there. When we got to the second store, I told her that we're both upset and that we should talk about what's bothering us but she refused. We went the rest of the time at the second store mostly quiet towards each other with me occasionally asking to discuss our feelings about the situation. After we sat back in the car, she drove me back to the dorms and told me that she's not obligated to drive me around, I told her that I was also upset and wasn't being half as petty as she was to which she told me to get out of her car.

After she came back from her shopping trip, I stopped by her dorm room and apologized for the way I acted, afterwards I told her that she was being petty by kicking me out of her car instead of talking about the situation with me and that I thought her comments were rude and offensive. She defended her position saying that she did nothing wrong and that she was only expressing her opinion. She kicked me out of the room again believing that my apology wasn't genuine and that I only wanted to justify myself.

Later that night I stopped by her dorm again asking if we could talk about what happened again, and an hour later she stopped by my dorm. When we got to her room, I asked for an apology for what I felt was unfair treatment.

bpivvz,1558044542,AITA for cutting everyone out of my life?,"Had to repost this because my previous one exceeded character limit of 3000, so some details may be missing (you can look at my longer post if you go to my profile). Throwaway for what will be obvious reasons. This is a bit of a long story, and I apologize for any rambling or unclear points. My life changed roughly five years ago when I was convicted and sent to prison for a crime I did not do. A few months ago I was shown to be innocent and released. As I would rather not put identifying the information out on the internet, this will be the most I’ll provide (I even gave a generic five years in case someone is able to track my case through the timeframe).

Upon my release, many people who I considered family and friends reached out to me saying congratulations, wanted to meet up, and other typical shit I guess. Except none of them visited me in prison. The only person I’ve had visit was my mother. She visited a few times my first year in prison, then never returned.

I asked a few of them why they never visited. There’s a shit ton of reasons being told to me. “I just never really had the time, busy with work.” “I knew you were innocent, I just I couldn’t bear to see you like that.” “The prison system is confusing, I couldn’t figure out how to request a visit.” and more. Somewhat ironically the only reason that I got that I can actually respect is “I thought you were guilty. I no longer wanted to associate with you.”

Even my best friend that I’ve known since I was three years old didn’t visit me. They wrote to me though, but it trailed off. There’s not much conversation to be had when every day of my life was exactly the same. They got bored with me, I guess.

So I cut them all off. I told them that they weren’t my friends or family - rather rudely, admittedly. Most of them accepted it (with some apologizing) and didn’t contact me again, but some people like my dad got pissed. Accused me of being an asshole and I had unrealistic expectations of them considering that I was in prison. That they were being nice to reach out to me after I got released and it’s rude to throw it back into their face. They became defensive of their behavior.

I used to be a person with dreams and ideals and aspirations - and that person would have been their friend again. But right now I’m okay in my small apartment that I split rent with someone that I only really know their name, playing whatever games get my attention, and working just enough to continue living. And I don’t want anyone who pretends to still be my friend showing up at my doorstep.

The only people I can really tolerate are my mother and the best friend that wrote for a while. But even with them, I’m pretty distant. I’m considering cutting it off with them too. I’d feel bad though, since I know it would hurt them - and I still care about them at least. No one likes making their mother cry.

 Am I/would I be the asshole?

I appreciate the responses I've received. A few tell me that I should make new friendships although this, too, is hard.

cupux5,1566627296,AITA for refusing to stay at my dad's house?,"So, some backstory.

I'm 15 years old, and my mom and dad are divorced. Early September of 2018, homecoming was coming up and it was going to be my first one. My grades weren't doing too hot at the time unfortunately, but this will be important. My whole thing about homecoming was that I wasn't going to go unless I was asked out. Well, surprise surprise, I got asked out by my friend, who I'll call Sarah. 

So in second period (we have gym together) I got into the hall to call my parents. I call my mom first, and she tells me to call my dad so I then call my dad. When I tell him I was asked out by Sarah, he went silent for a moment. He then asked me about my grades. Fancy talk for ""I can't have my daughter think I'm homophobic.""

So when I went to his house the weekend before homecoming, my step-sister who I'll call Erin said that my dad said that ""if I went to homecoming with my mom(going to her house the weekend of), I wasn't welcome back at the house."" I obviously deemed this bullshit because Erin had a tendency to lie and make up literal bullshit. Anyways, I was wanting to go to my mom's so she could help me get ready in the first place because I didn't trust my step-mother with helping me get ready at all. When we actually got home my step-mom told me my dad needed to talk with me later. When he got home, he got a bit situated and then called me into his room to talk. 

When we talked, we talked about how my grades were bad, and how that was a factor of why I was not going. He also said I was too young to date, and I should only be dating at 16. Ok, I agreed with that to a degree. And then sexuality came up. He basically took Onision's opinion on bisexual people, and was arguing with me. I was trying to defend myself but I was completely powerless in the situation. I cried really hard, and when we were finally done he tried comforting me and saying he still loved me. It still didn't hide the fact I was hurt and he was the cause. And it turns out, Erin was correct, as he stated himself the same thing to my face.

Cut to next weekend and I stayed after school when I was supposed to be with my dad. He had messaged me asking where I was and I told him I decided to stay with mom. He then called me, and it was mostly quiet. He stuck to his word. My friend comforted me before we were picked up as I was crying hard again. It hurt.

I haven't been at my dad's since September now, and he's now trying to tell me he misses me and he wants me back ""home"". When I stopped going, he'd sent an email to my mom with one sentence saying ""I will not have a gay daughter."" Harsh. He later said it was taken out of context, which is obviously bullshit since it's a full sentence. 

My dad has done numerous other things to make him even worse, but those things are unrelated. I still refuse to go to his house because of how much he hurt me, and just thinking of spending time with him? I can already feel the awkward tension.

7y29kq,1518818191,AITA for answering to my classmates,"This requires a bit of background, but I'll be as brief as possible.

We're postgrad Creative Writing students, and you can count us on the fingers of one hand. Our first term was somewhat chaotic, since nobody seemed to be able to give us actual directions regarding our assignments. My classmates despised that. I have no idea what directions a CW assignment needs other than ""creatively write 5000 words"" and was, therefore, fine with it.

Our professor was especially vague. His lessons went on constant tangents, and his directions on the assignments were ""write 5000 words in a creative way"". Again, my classmates hated that. Things important to mention for later: he's our program coordinator, he teaches more than just our group, he got sick one week and we made those lost classes up later on. 

Now the second term has begun, we've changed professor, and my class has suddenly decided that the previous one was in fact a useless sexist asshole, and they're badmouthing him at every turn. All I can say on the sexist angle is: I was arguing about a movie with him, he said ""it treats male privilege as if it doesn't exist!"" and the rest of the class keeps on swearing he said ""male privilege doesn't exist."" So, you know, that's that.

Today he sent all of us an email that basically says two things, namely; 1) since we missed some classes we'll discuss how to make up for lost time, 2) we have to meet one-on-one to discuss your topic for next year.

Now, to me, it seems obvious that, 1) we've already made up out lost lessons. It obviously follows he confused us with the wrong group, and we shall let him know that. 2) He's our module coordinator, so yeah, we gotta do that. Easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy.

My classmate, however, believe that to be difficult-difficult-lemony-difficult. Follows this (shortened and slightly paraphrased) conversation;



**Classmate1**: ""Getting that email really bums me out. Didn't we make up all those classes?"" 

**Me**: ""Yes we did. He probably got it wrong, we shall let him know."" 

**Classmate2**: ""Um... wtf is going on.""

**Classmate3**: ""I'm confused, didn't we already have all those classes? I thought it was the other group that missed out altogether?"" 

**Me**: ""Yes it was. He probably got confused. We'll have to tell him next week.""

**C1**: ""I'm just not looking forward to anything having to do with him.""

**Me**: ""I understand that."" 

**C3**: ""But we already found a supervisor for next year, we shouldn't have anything to do with him anymore.""

**Me**: ""He's our module coordinator, so I believe he has to deal with us this year. We'll deal with our supervisors next year, when we do research."" 

**C3**: ""I was under the impression that he has little to do with the administration side, not that he ever did anyway. I'm so not up for dealing with him.""

**Me**: ""Well, if he has nothing to do with the administration anymore, i assume whoever does now will let him know."" 

**C3**: ""No, he still does, he just never actually works. As we know.""

**Me**: ""How lovely that he's decided to start now, then""



So yes, that's the conversation (I can upload it, if it comes to that) and I can't help but ask... was I an asshole? I know people sometimes just want to complain and maybe I should have just let them complain. Maybe I was too rude. Should I apologize? I assume I was rude, but I just...

4bbgk8,1458547915,AITA for funneling troops to defend a city state from my friend (Civ 5)?,"This feels more like an /r/civ topic, but it probably goes against like 10 rules there.

Anyway, I was playing Civ 5 with 5 friends.  I was on a continent with 2 friends, 2 were together, 1 was by himself.  I started exploring and found my friend Jim as India down on a decent-sized island away from me.  He was complaining about going to war with a city state.  He's kinda new, so he was just sending in like 5 elephants (not the best way of doing it, but would work).  

I felt kinda bad watching the city state about to get pummeled, so I thought ""hey, it'd be funny if I gifted a troop to them.""  Gifting a unit instantly sends them across the map to that city state.  I sent over an archer, and Jim had to retreat.

Later on he tried a couple more times to attack the city state, and I sent troops over there again.  After a certain point I thought it'd be funny to reveal my prank, so I said something like

""Man, that city state has a lot of firepower.""

""Yeah, it's bullshit!""

""Jee wiz.  It's almost like they have a mysterious benefactor gifting them troops.""

""...""

Then I came clean and told them I'd been sending troops.  My friends call me an asshole a few times.  The city state wasn't going to murder Jim, or anything, so I wasn't doing it out of malice, but I felt kinda bad and apologized.  Jim goes quiet for like 30 turns, and suddenly I see the ""Jim has declared war on Packrat1010.""

I'm sitting there like, ""Cmon, I'm an era ahead of you, don't go to war with me.""

He says, ""It's already on!  This'll teach you to send troops to a guy I'm fighting.""

Basically, for anyone who hasn't played Civ, being an era apart is kind of a big deal competitively.  I have more production, can get units out faster, and have better units.

So I'm like, ""Alright, I guess.""  I start pumping out galleass's (basically a medieval ship that can fire cannons on land) like it's nothing.  I get 6-7 up and running in a few turns, then I start sending them to his city.  On the way there, I see the boats transporting a bunch of his elephants towards me, and I just mow down the living shit out of them.

Now, Jim is a little easy to upset, so I PM'd a friend of mine at the start of the war that I was willing to accept a surrender whenever he sent it.  That being said, I get to his city and just start bombing it.  He fires back and sinks one of my ships, but I just keep going.  I feel kind of good about downing his massive army that he was waving around, so I finally whittle down his city and take it.

I'm thinking, ""Alright, I spanked him good, lemme send a peace treaty to him and give him his city back.""  Well, I pull up the diplomacy screen and see that he already sent me a peace treaty.  5 turns ago.  I had absolutely no idea he sent it, since he never said anything.

Basically, I started whooping him, and to him I saw the peace treaty, said ""Nah, bitch, that ass is mine,"" then just kept powering down while my friends looked on with a mix of fear and disgust. 

I accepted the treat, then said, ""Hey, man, I didn't realize you already sent that--""

""Yeah, you didn't see it!"" he shouts at me,  ""You never see shit!""

Then he disconnected, and I sat through 5 or so minutes of everyone grumbling about how I ""took it too far"" and ""was muttering obscenities under your breath as you sunk his cavalry ships like wax boats.""

I asked my ex to ask whether my daughter would like to go, and got questioned about my commitment to my daughter's safety because I wouldn't make it a condition of the sleepover that I could stay the first night.

Background:

My ex-wife and I have a 10 year old daughter (about to go into 5th grade). We share custody and each have her one week with the change-over day on Saturday at noon. This week is a little odd in that my ex is going on a two week vacation beginning on Sunday and asked if she could keep our daughter on Saturday, since she would be missing her time with her for a whole week. I agreed. So, the change-over date would be on Sunday.

I got a text at 8 pm, this Thursday, from one of my daughter's friend's parents' asking if my daughter would like to go to a recreational spot for a long weekend sleepover (leave Fri night, return Tues afternoon). She has never had a sleepover with this friend, but has know her since 1st grade. I have known the dad since that time, at least casually. (mutual birthday parties, school events, etc).

I asked my ex if she would ask our daughter if she would like to go. (If it matters, my ex would be giving up her Friday and Saturday night with her, and I would give up Sunday thru Tues.)

Ultimately, she was willing to let me take our daughter to the cabin on Sunday but would ask our daughter if it was something she wanted to do. Which is almost what I wanted. I would have preferred she would have asked our daughter if she wanted to go for the entire weekend, but I understand her not being willing to give up Friday and Saturday since she was going to miss out on a week with our daughter during her trip.

&#x200B;

Argument and Possible Assholishness: 

During this discussion, my ex offered to let our daughter go to the sleepover on Saturday (a day earlier) if I were to go and stay the night with her. I responded that the idea of me inviting myself to a sleepover for my daughter was a non-starter. I wasn't going to do that. And this is where the argument began. Apparently, if I am not willing to put myself into an awkward social position of inviting myself to a sleepover, I am not willing to protect my daughter. She mentioned that this was going to be brought up in future discussions. So, does that make me an asshole?

&#x200B;

Why I Don't Think I Am An Asshole:

If I didn't feel comfortable letting my daughter sleep over at another friend's house, I wouldn't let her go. I don't think that inviting myself to a sleepover for one night of three would prevent anything bad happening.

b0uue1,1552530332,AITA for being upset that my mom is going back to school?,"It’s honestly a little more complicated than that.

My mom has me as a teenager and because of that, had a rough time making a life for herself. She went to a community college when I was younger, my step-dad continued working and one of my older cousins lived with us for a while to help take care of me and my younger brothers until my mom graduated.

For a while, both my parents worked and I started taking care of my brothers most nights because of my parents work schedule. Well not a perfect system, it worked well enough.

And then my mom wanted to go to school again. Which was fine with me when my stepdad was still working. But then my stepdad got sick. 

I honestly am very upset with my parents about this. I think it’s irresponsible of her to not work more than a day a week when we clearly don’t have enough money to stay a float currently (I know for a fact we don’t given she constantly complains about it to me) and to leave me to take care of my brothers and stepdad. She’s never home even when she doesn’t have school because she thinks our house is too distracting. I do everything around the house. All the chores, grocery shopping, making sure everyone gets to school on time, making sure my stepdad is okay, cooking, etc. I didn’t have much of a life outside of my family and school before this all happened, which was fine. But now it literally doesn’t exist because there’s just not enough hours in the day. 

I never told my parents how I felt that they are being irresponsible and being unfair for putting this amount of stress on me when I’m still a teenager because I know for a fact they would consider me the asshole in this situation.

b287aj,1552847112,AITA For being angry with my parents for blocking my internet.,"Edit. Just to be clearer. My parents set a be downstairs by 9:30 rule for daily tasks and instructions. However to meet that I'd need to be *up* by 8 am. I wasnt required to while sick. But the immediate day after i began to get better I was required to. I was out of bed by 9:30 that day but that meant i missed the deadline. 

Edit 2. My family homeschools but im no longer a part of that. 
Also, im sorry for my grammarand the random periods in my replies. Im on mobile with nerve damaged fingers and its hard to type. Please be patient with me!

So 2 days ago, my dad (both him and my mom are massive narcissists tho dad tends to enable more than be directly narcissistic) turned off my pc internet due to my not being on time.

However, Im 20 (almost 21) and *I pay rent. Which includes paying for my internet.*

Needless to say Im angry. He asked me once to improve being on time, however *everyone* was sick for a week. (My mom even said ""she felt like she was actually dying"") and I wasnt waking up till 12 to.1 pm. No one was. And Im expected to go within a day from waking up at 12 to waking up at 8.

Thats nearly impossible for me. I make habits easily and its hard to break them. I'm also eating terribly because I was so sick. 

However I set double alarms and started going to bed early. Mind you I was ""better"" by Wednesday. And thursday I was up by 9:30. Still not good enough. So dad blocked my internet. But I pay for it. 

So now I'm fighting with them nearly non stop. I'm not even truly trying to. A great example is I asked for a chunck of time that I wouldn't even be home in to be unblocked, so I could upload a video to YouTube, and my dad had to literally start screaming at me. 

My whole family is angry at me and saying Im being a bully and a jerk for arguing so much. I just want my internet back. I paid my rent and I dont care if you want to punish me for being late, just dont mess with things I paid for. ",1552849767.0,not the asshole,11,63,0

dqnanv,1572715415,AITA on ghosting my group of friends,"So... I have this group of friends from high school (4 girls). I'm the funny friend and rarely talk about my feelings or how some things that they do hurt me. We have very different life backgrounds and the nature of our issues are different. I'm also not a fan of drama but I am a good listener to their problems.

I live alone since I was 17 (25 now) and that makes me feel very lonely most of the time. I slowly started to realize that I'm the last option for a lot of people... So I started to shrink my circle lately because of the hard times I went through while feeling absolutely alone. This September I had to put my 10yo dog down after 3 months of me fighting very hard to save her from cancer. She had surgery, non stop visits to the vet. At the end, I was physically and mentally devastated. Everyone that I know was aware of her condition. One people or two sent me messages asking if I was ok but nobody cared enough to pay me a visit. (The girls in this specific group all live 5 minutes from my house) 

That's just one more of the things that I swalled in silence and has been building up. I came to the realization that specially for this group of friends, I'm always the one who has to make time and go out of my way if I want to hangout with them. They're never up to do something when I hit them up spontaneously, and when they do things together, they usually don't invite me, or do it last minute. 

Last night I reached my limit. I have been trying to gather and hangout with them as much as possible as I'm going to move out of the country in the next few months (they know it). I spent the last two weeks trying to find a day and time to throw a little house party, so I asked them to decide the day and hour. They all agreed upon it and I came out of my own plans to make it work. The party was supposed to be today, and last night they started to talk in our group chat how they wish it was earlier (than the hour they picked) or how they would only be able to stay for a couple of minutes because they had other plans. 

I got terribly disappointed to the fact that don't mean anything to these people I know for almost 10 years now and hold so dear. I told them they should have told me a little before so I could have the chance to make plans for my weekend and gone on a trip I was invited to yesterday morning. One of them said right to my face ""I would have bailed and gone on the trip"". I lost it and left the group chat and deleted them from all my socials.

My brother is 2 years older than me, in his early 20s, and was extremely close to me for the first 12-14 years of my life. The thing is, he is mentally ill and has a form of autism and mild schizophrenia. He's been very supportive of LGBT rights for a very long time. Last year I had a conversation with him about my homosexual orientation, I've discovered that he is currently a homophobe - because the two gay people he met in person were ""perverts"", and even denies the scientific legitimacy of being homosexual. He hopes that I'll ""change"" and even threatened to dissuade my boyfriend from a relationship once I get one (never had one).

She’s said they’re not just for others to follow, but just as a reminder to herself. It’s ridiculous. 

These rules are like; don’t sit down anywhere without telling where. Wash your hands after coming inside. Wash your hands after eating before touching anything. Don’t sit down anywhere without permission, etc etc. It’s really annoying.

Of course I always tend to forget about the rule pages around, I’m used to them there so I pay no mind. Because of this I had forgotten some of the rules, and sat down on the couch (which had her clean laundry on it so I just moved it to the side)  while she was in the bathroom.

Needless to say, she was panicked when she saw. Apparently she didn’t know if my hands were safe or not, and since I had moved her laundry it is now “infected” and “unsafe” which gave her a TOTAL breakdown.

She started crying, asking me why I would do such a horrible thing. I find her behaviour absolutely ridiculous, overdramatic, so I tell her to just get over it! This pissed her off even more. She told me to please leave and that I was an asshole because she can’t help it.

The Uber driver dropped me off and I got out thinking everything was fine, however since I'd never been to the house before I mapped it only to see I was still a good 12 minute walk away.

For context:  We are generally both good students at school and have had similar grades and achievements in the past.

My twin and I both took this exam during the beginning of Sophomore year after studying for it over the summer. Because I concentrated more on studying while my twin spent more time on other things (reading books, playing games, etc.), I scored significantly better than him on the test, though we both scored quite well for a first try. Because my parents wanted my brother to get a higher score, they offered to buy him a new iPhone if he reached a set score. He took it again at the beginning of junior year and got this score, so my parents bought him a new phone worth 1000 dollars. Now, I am planning on taking the test again, and asked my parents if they would give me the same prize if I were to reach the set score for my twin. My parents responded that since I scored higher originally, I had to increase my score by how much my twin did, which is more than what it takes to get a perfect score, so they said I had to get a perfect score to get the prize. While I understand this situation sounds quite privileged, I still feel that my parents should give me and twin the same standards for earning a prize, especially because the initial difference in scores was due to a difference in time studying, which my parents agree with. However, they still say that I must get a perfect score to get the prize that my twin got. To be honest, it feels like I am losing out on a easier opportunity just because I worked harder to prepare the first time. What do you guys think?

p.s. My parents have also offered the same reward with my twin’s second score, but with the added condition that if I don’t meet it (I get the same or worse as my previous score), I have to give them 500 dollars of my own money, which is a condition that was never mentioned when my twin retook it.",False,not the asshole,655,128,0

The cake is particularly a big deal, and usually people are very specific about what they want. We recently hired a new girl who so far has been great, and her birthday happened to be this week, so I set about asking her last week what kind of cake she wanted. She didn't ask for something really specific, but she specified that she'd like any kind of ice cream cake, any kind of cake with fruit and cream, or with interesting tea flavors. She also said absolutely no vegan cakes and no chocolate, which as you can guess, puts this cake off the list for most people. 

We have a few people with dietary restrictions, and they've mentioned feeling a bit sad at being left out before, so I thought it was pretty unfair of her to specify that she wants to exclude some people. Of course, no chocolate is also difficult to deal with with an office full of people since most people love chocolate. We've had wacky requests before, but it still seemed really off to me especially since she's so new. And since I'm technically in charge of the whole day party thing, I thought it would be nice if I could find something that she loved but that also everyone could enjoy. I ordered a beautiful matcha and strawberry vegan cake from a local bakery whose vegan baked goods I've had before, and thought it would be great. 

Come to the party. Everything was fine and good, she thought the cake looked beautiful, she was super happy...until she bit into it. Somehow, she could tell it was vegan. She asked me if it was, I confirmed, and she put the piece back down, gave me a look, and kind of walked off. 

My boss was pretty pissed and basically told me that I need to redo the party and get her a proper cake for the evening party and another one on Friday to make up for this.

On top of that, my boss mentioned she is an extremely valuable asset to the team, and that he knew for a fact she had other great offers.

So today I was running some errands, and one of my stops was the bank in a local strip mall.

My curiosity was piqued. I stood a respectable distance back, but close enough to see and hear what was going on. And I watched.

The man was up in her face yelling about how both she and her dog are divas, and this is an open space and his dog can do what he wants if he's not hurting anyone. The lady was yelling back that it's a service dog in training and she asked him to keep his distance.

(I got here after the incident that caused the yelling happened, but I suspect that the man's dog approached the woman's service dog in training and she asked him to give her space, causing this blow up).

Anyways after a few minutes of yelling they both noticed me standing there. I was clearly engrossed in their altercation and my pose and distance made that obvious. I got asked what I was doing and said, ""Um, listening to you guys yell.""

This prompted them both to call me an asshole (and to give me the inspiration to post here!). It also resulted in the end of the scene, with the man leaving and myself continuing to the bank.

If I did, I'd ask a friend to remind me if they noticed I hadn't done it. Since I've been home, my parents have been on my case about when I take my insulin and how to treat my blood sugars. I understand that they're coming from a good place, but I feel like the constant reminders are making me more reliant on their assistance and less on my own ability to care for myself. Last week, after discussing with a therapist, I asked my parents to cut back on the policing and to let me do my own thing.

bo863q,1557776600,AITA for buying my aunts house?,"2 years ago, i had saved enough for a down payment and began house hunting. I was looking for a house specifically on a few acres and affordable, but nothing i really had to remodel. 

This really isn't the most affordable home to look for, So i looked for a good 6 months. I got an email from Zillow one day showing me a house that was a ""buy my house"" option. It was an option for a homeowner to put feelers out before they put it on the market. I opened the email and my aunt's family's old house is for sale. Its the house my close cousin grew up in. They lived there for 15+ years and never really took care of it, and lost it to foreclosure while in a divorce. 
My aunt and i dont have a good relationship (narcissist) but my cousin and i do. Uncle isnt really in the picture. 

The home had been owned by someone else for 5 years, and they completely remodeled the house, and it was perfect. I instantly sent it to my cousin. I showed her and told her i was interested in seeing it! But showed her first. So she could see what awesome work was done to the house. Shes a pretty sentimental person. And told her if she wanted first dibs on the house I'd abandon plans to look at it. She asked her boyfriend and he said they honestly didnt have the money, and werent in a place to buy a home. She had no job. He is the sole earner and they're not married. 
I didn't contact my aunt. Because we really try to avoid speaking to each other. And she's happily remarried in a new home she seems to love. 

So I went ahead and looked at the house. They had it set at an unbeatable price. And I put an offer on it the same day. The offer was accepted. And i live there to this day. 

My cousin immediately hated me for buying the house. Her childhood home. Because she couldn't have it. I told her that me buying the house would probably actually give her the opportunity to buy it from me in the future whenever they are ready. Instead of going to people who plan to live the rest of their lives in it. I honestly don't plan on living here forever but I definitely plan on living here 5-10 years. 
My aunt also got insanely mad. Telling everyone in the family i didnt deserve it and that she wished my mortgage fell through and I couldn't buy it. 

I still get shit about it, to this day, from family members telling me it was a real asshole move for me to buy this house. I feel like I did everything I should have by offering it to my cousin first. So. Am i the asshole?",False,not the asshole,11,17,0
c63o2g,1561629715,WIBTA if I gave my parents a car but told them I couldn't financially help them when it came to repairs?,"**Edit- thanks for your help everyone. I am going to tell them before I give them the car that if they take it on, the maintenance is their responsibility and will in no way fall upon me. If they feel they cannot afford that in the future I will just sell it. Thanks again**

Lurker, first time poster. Blah blah blah.

OK so, maybe about 3 or 4 years ago my parents had to give up their car, it needed a lot of repairs and they couldn't afford to pay the large sum or buy another vehicle.

I recently started driving in Nov 18, bought a reletively cheap car for myself with the intention of keeping it for around a year and then buying myself something slightly better when I had more driving experience. I thought instead of keeping it and selling it for a small sum I would give it to my parents as a nice gesture, it would be a lot more convenient for them to get shopping and for my dad to get to work, so I offered it to them and they said yes!

Here's the issue, my parents are horrible with money and my mother doesn't work. She's had a lot of jobs but always leaves for various excuses and it doesn't look like she will be getting one anytime soon (I think my dad has basically given up on hassling her to get one). Money is always tight with them, so my worry is that if I give them this car that when it needs work done they will ask me for help to pay for repairs. The thing is, I wouldn't mind that but I know that this will turn out to be a payment plan over a number of months e.g £20 a month until they're all paid up and by then they will probably need something else done to the car. I can definitely afford to help them out but I can't afford to get my money back in dribbles.

My boyfriend has told me I should give them the car and make it clear that if I give them it that I cannot help them out financially with repairs etc, however I don't know if that would just put them in more financial burden when the time comes.
They did say that If it came down to it and I'd prefer to sell the car that they would understand, however I feel guilty grabbing something away that I have already offered to them.

So WIBTA if I told my parents I couldn't help them financially with this car?

b9c0tq,1554380517,AITA for sleeping with two people when I was single but seriously talking to someone else ( but not exclusive)?,"So in June I went on a solo backpacking trip through the balkins for two months . I've been exclusive and seeing my current girlfriend since August. I've been seeing her on and off since Januaty last year. 

From January to June we had a friend's with benefits situation going on and I really saw her as a good friend who I like hooking up with but I didn't really see myself long term with her. To clarify we've spoken about this and have established boundaries and expectations. 

Leading up to the trip I started to develop emotions for her but I wasn't sure if I wanted to commit to her before I left on a solo two month trip. I felt like if I wasn't a 100percent sure I would regret that decision so much. I told her this and how I was starting to feel about her but I wanted my freedom on this trip. 

So when it came time for the trip we've gotten pretty close and she even drove with me and my dad to the airport to drop me off. During the two months we texted almost every day. During the course of my trip I met two girls and we ended up sleeping together. Near the end of my trip she was feeling down and insecure and asked me if I hooked up with anyone and I was honest with her. This led to her crying and a series of arguments saying I led her on, that I essentially cheated on her, and that she can't trust me. We eventually worked it out and I told her I'd commit to her that very moment and wouldn't see anyone else. 

Now it's April, it's been awhile and we've had wonderful times together but she uses this as leverage to every fight we've had. Shes having so much trouble letting go and I've apologized so many times and I've tried to comfort her but this just won't seem to stay in the past. Whenever we have any issues it's used as a dagger against me. She says that its not fair for me to tell her she needs to let it go and move on forward because she's the one dealing with the pain of it and that Im not carrying any emotional burdens from it.

bvoynz,1559419791,AITA for denying my future sister-in-law an engagement ring?,"EDIT: Update Below. Thank you all for your comments and advice! I appreciate your input regardless of where you stand. 

I come from three generations of jewelers and though my family is no longer in the business, I still enjoy buying and selling loose gemstones for my own collection or to be set into custom pieces. I am extremely close to my husband’s family and I have either cheaply sold or simply given them stones/rings to propose to their significant others. 

My oldest brother-in-law has been dating his girlfriend for the past six years and while they are both a piece of work to say the least, they’re family so we tolerate them in doses. While we talk to and visit the other in-laws on a weekly basis, these two only come around when an event is going on or when they need money.... and they alway need money. My pending sister-in-law, while sweet at times is mostly bratty, tacky, spoiled and loud. She usually is the source of drama and my current headache at the moment. 

Every first Saturday of the month, the family hooks up for breakfast. Things started off normally today but they announced that finally, they were ready to tie the knot. We all had genuine excitement and breakfast turned into a boozy celebration. Then near the end while everyone is waiting for the check, they ask if they can come back to the house to pick out a ring. 

Just like that. Mic drop. It shocked me because they didn’t ask, he didn’t come to me or hubby beforehand to see if it was even a possibility. AND while I do have some options, I did not appreciate the assumption that I was going pull diamonds out of my ass without any discussion and straight up said no. I’d be willing to help them find something at their price point commercially. My inner Smaug woke up. 

All hell broke loose. She straight up throws a fit and begins calling out my other sister-in-laws who did have help from me with their rings and of course they are embarrassed. It’s not something we just talk about and I don’t hang it over anyone’s head. Brother-in-law starts trying to pick a fight with my husband telling him that he needs to “check me.” All of this is driving home that my on the spot decision was the right one. 

Drama apparently wants to have it’s day because while most of the table is trying to diffuse this until we can leave the restaurant, my mother-in-law of all people throws rocket fuel on the dumpster fire by saying that I’m being selfish and that there’s no reason why we shouldn’t help. She and I have had our differences in the past (during my and my husband’s crazy/horny teenage years) but haven’t openly feuded since we’ve been adults. 

Being the superhero that he his, my husband got us TF out of there but since this morning, we have been ignoring our phones as this plays out. We’re both pissed. 

—Update:

This took up my whole Saturday. MIL and FIL came over in person to talk about what happened. FIL agreed that BIL and future SIL were out of line and apologized in their behalf. 

Once this came out of his mouth, MIL had a meltdown. She still believed that a ring was deserved and even after explaining my reasoning basically said that, “I set a standard and since they can not afford it on their own, it was MY responsibility to step up.” I nearly lost it with her but instead of giving back all the venom that I’d been choking on, I left the house. 

FIL came outside and helped me calm down while she and Hubs talked. I haven’t gone in depth of how this affected things IRL but the fallout spread fast. The family has been through a lot recently and I did not want this to add more into the pot even though pettiness was strong within me. 

Between talking to him and texting my husband at ground zero, I actually decided to compromise. I have a pear shaped moissanite that I bought out of curiosity but did nothing with after it started trending a few years ago. For those who do not know, moissanite is a popular alternative to diamonds. It’s just been sitting in my collection and I figured why the fuck not. I could actually give them something and be done with it all providing that apologies were made to myself, the other inlaws and that they got it set on their own. FIL did not want me to offer it at first but I explained why and he reluctantly agreed. 

He called BIL, shred him for a moment but eventually told them my terms. I got on the line and explained what the moissanite was, the weight and cut since I had no idea what her preferences were. Other in-laws chose stones that weren’t traditional as well so I wanted to make sure she even wanted what I offered. They did. The change in their attitudes felt like this was the right choice. I told them to just come on over. Once they got here, they immediately apologized and Hubs got MIL to do the same though he gave me the worst side eye the whole time. Showed them the stone and future SIL just starts squirting tears out of happiness. I’m a big softy. Honestly, If things hadn’t gone down they way they did, I would have cried with her. 

I gave her the stone’s certification after the waterworks and things did a compete 360. She and BIL went from loving it to being offended that the damned thing wasn’t a diamond even though I’d explained this when giving the specs on the phone! She was actively FaceTiming her HER mom showing her the stone on her hand which lead to them calling me a horrible person for getting their hopes up. BIL stops short of insulting me again as Hubs stepped in and instead says that I’ve disrespecting his fiancé the whole time. MIL actually had the audacity to demand that SHE will pick out a “real stone” and to see what else I have like I’m a fucking sales clerk; not in my own house. Here I am staring at this twilight zone clusterfuck as they start arguing and I’m just standing in my kitchen watching it all play out again.

I have reached levels of real anger before but I think this was the first time I could say I felt actual fury. They pushed me to fulfill my lifelong dream to scream at people to get the fuck out of my house at the top of my lungs. (Repressed feelings much) Things got quiet fast and in that space, I snatched my shit back so fast that I accidentally dropped the moissy and it bounced or got kicked out of sight. Cue my inappropriate, fed up laughter. I couldn’t hold it in. 

Hubs and FIL got everyone out after that and as of now, they are banned from the house. I’m cutting them all off with no remorse. As of yet, no one has called me personally but word is that the Grand Dame is livid (I still don’t know why she’s so vehement about all of this tbh) while BIL and SIL are thinking about getting tattoos vs rings. I have no comment. Hubs feels like he’s at fault for everything but I’ve explained there’s no way I blame him for his family’s actions. He thought I was too nice to offer anything. FIL and I are linking up to discuss Reddit as he’s amazed by the platform so hey, something good came from this. 

We have looked for the stone and so far we have no fucking idea where it is. Confession time: it’s slightly satisfying that we can’t locate it. Where is Sister Unella when you need her?

c558vj,1561451930,AITA for refusing to stop kissing my girlfriend in shared spaces in my home," So: I´ve (32F) been living with my roommates (28F, 28F) for close to six years now. We've been very close and have moved houses earlier, to be able to continue to live together. We've even called each other family.

Last year I got a new girlfriend (28F). Me and my roommates have known her and her previous girlfriend for years, and we've all been pretty close. Part of the problem is that my GF left her ex for me, which of course changed the whole dynamic in the group.

After that my roommates told me that they didn't want us to show that we are a couple in any of the shared spaces in our home. They said that they were very uncomfortable with almost any displays of affection between us. They had two different arguments for this: one was emotional (it made them uncomfortable) and the other ideologic (they don´t want there to be a difference in how people are treated in a group setting, and by partners hugging/kissing they are excluding the rest of the group).

To be clear: we're talking about holding hands, hugging, quick kisses. Nothing inappropriate or in any way sexual in nature. My roommates wanted it to stop. As I said, we've lived together for a long time and have all had dates/partners but this was never an issue before.

At first i thought that this was due to them having a hard time accepting that my GF and her ex changing their relationship and had various feelings of guilt and empathy for GFs ex. So I agreed that me and my GF would stop the displays of affection and we did so for almost 6 months. Then I wanted to revisit the issue and my roommates got very upset with me when I told them this was not a longtime solution for me.

They said that they would not be OK with it now or ever, and I said that I couldn't accept these terms. In the course of these conversations they told me that they were thinking about telling guests in the house to not hug/kiss, and that one of them has even told friends who she was visiting at their home to stop showing they are a couple. This is totally unacceptable to me, both to treat guests like that and to treat hosts that bad when you are the guest.

The roommates both feel that they are completely in their right to ban physical touch and that I am being egoistic for not respecting that. They feel that their actions are not only acceptable but what most people would have done (since my GF was with our friend before). I feel that this is not the case and that they are acting weird and are being really shitty friends to me and my GF.

I'm standing behind her and her family and while the mother is talking about paint colors the husband grabs the girl by the back of the neck leans in close and starts whispering.  I was only able to hear because I was behind them, but he was saying ""is that makeup I see?"" over and over while squeezing.  Eventually, she said ""It hurts"" and punched him in the chest once.  I hoped he would release her so I could ask her if she needed help, but he kept holding down the back of her neck and said ""We'll discuss this at home"".  When they went to leave I asked her if she was OK or if she needed help.  I could immediately smell the alcohol from the father right then.  I said I was a teacher and I am a mandatory state reporter and if she felt in danger or needed help, she could tell me.  She looked at him (with his hand still on her neck) and he said ""Go ahead, tell him"" and she said ""no"".

The wife took it and explained that it was how the two of them normally interacted.

arm12v,1550420599,AITA for not wanting to play D&D with an annoying roommate?,"A bit of context. I am traveling in Australia at the moment and have been staying at a hostel in Melbourne for the last few months. Recently I managed to start a group playing Dungeons and Dragons, which is one of my passions. I taught a group of seven people how to play and we're running through a short campaign. I have put a lot of effort into preparing and running the game, regularly hourspreparing both my stuff and the players' (since they don't know the rules yet), as well as my own money on printing and dice.

Enter my roommate C. C has been in my room for the last week or so. To begin with we didn't really talk much, until he invited me and two other roommates out for lunch (both roommates also players in my game and my friends). When we went to lunch it was clear that C was a very intense person, shouting and laughing incredibly loudly in a public restaurant, punching me in a friendly manner. He also tends to be a little domineering, he will go on loud rants and shout angrily if you interrupt him. 

Over the next week, his behaviour became increasingly erratic. He had a long rant about typical 'nice guy' stuff and shouted at me when I tried to cut him off. At one point he had a go at me and the other roommates for 'excluding him', which is maybe a fair comment but somewhat natural given that we have been in the same room for weeks and are close friends. He also regularly got in my personal space despite me asking not to. On Friday we played D&D again and he turned up at 3, not having told me he was coming. I politely told him that since I didn't know he was playing I didn't have a character for him, but I'd be happy to make one with him for next time. He was visibly sad but accepted this. At this point I fully intended to let him play next time.

Yesterday, he again looked down so we asked him what was wrong and he told us his very sad life story, which I won't go into. Feeling sorry for him, I went out for lunch and had a pint with him. Alone, he was pleasant, if a little strange and the aforementioned obnoxiously loud. That night, we four had a few drinks and played some hands of poker. As the game progressed, C got worse and worse. He was as ever loud, but also rude, harrying people to take their turn while dragging his out as much as possible. After the poker, we kept drinking and his behaviour got worse and worse. He swore repeatedly at all of us, which is not something that bothers me but the two girls are kinda young and one of them took it to heart. He also made a pass at the other girl, despite being ten years her senior and her clear lack of interest (I feel some what fraternal towards these two girls as they are very young and kinda sensitive). I frequently asked him to chill out, at which he would apologise, and then quickly revert to form.

My concern is this: the members of my D&D group are new to the game. Several of them have expressed concerns about playing with him, and some are quite timid. I already find it challenging to run the game as it's a large group and they are all new. C has already exhibited behaviour that suggests he would not cooperate or listen, would be domineering and rude. Furthermore, the one time I've played a different game with him was not enjoyable.

8s41f1,1529363704,AITA for wanting to kick my sister out? And not caring where she she goes?,"Backstory. Me (29) sister (25) after going through a tough breakup I was set to move into a one bedroom apartment with me and my young son. My sister asked to come live with me. She previously lived with my mother but didn't want to move to the city where my mother was moving. I said no. She then began living with friends and got kicked out a month later. 
Having nowhere else to go, she asked to move in with me again. I relented and ended up getting a two bedroom farther than where I wanted to be and more rent than I wanted to pay. I did this for her because she doesn't drive and needed easy access to her school and her job. 
For the seven months i’ve lived with her, we have had the following issues.

-Constantly eating the food in the house but never actually contributing to said food. 
-Staining the bathroom walls, bath tub, and carpet with permanent hair dye ( more than likely resulting in not getting my full security deposit back) 
-no consideration ( playing music, talking on the phone ) at 7am when she wakes up but i would still be sleeping or at night ( trying to sleep and having to ask her to lower her voice), her seeing me trying to study but then would go upstairs and play music or talk loudly on her phone. 
- constantly using the dishwasher even though i’ve asked her not to (runs our bill up and we don’t make enough dirty dishes to run it everyday) 
-making small sum payments to the two bills that she pays (energy and internet) for April she paid $12.00 and May $7.00 to an energy bill that is usually around $80 a month. 
- she failed to tell me that the friends she was staying with had a massive roach problem and ended up bring roaches over with her. 

Before she moved in with me we agreed she would either be going to school full time and working part time or working full time and contributing to the rent. In February I found out she was only going to school part time ( about 3 classes that totaled 9 hours per week) I asked her why she wasn't working more hours then and she told me her job wasn’t giving her more hours. After more digging I found out that she had her schedule fixed at her job to not work any weekends. So they aren't giving her more hours because she was only scheduled to work 4 days during the week, after 2pm. This is a retail job where they are busiest during the weekend. When confronted, she said she didn't want to work weekends. 

At this point i’m over her. I’m not looking to fix anything, talk anymore, or try to help someone better themselves when they don’t even want to better themselves. She doesn't pay rent and it is taking her 4 years to get an associates degree. She doesn't drive and constantly uses lyft when there is a bus stop 5 minutes away from us.  I thought it would be a situation where we were both contributing to the household but I feel like i am being taken for granted. Recently i found a pregnancy test in her room.

Back in September or August I was at first a Bridesmaid in this friend's wedding. We have known each other for about 7 years at this point and she has done many things that hurt my feelings or pissed me off and I just shrugged it off until all of this came crashing down. 

Her maid of honor and her got into a fight and she asked me to be maid of honor. Sure, why not. 2 weeks later I was back to being a bridesmaid. Sure, why not. I just really didn't care how this fight was resolved or what started it in the first place because they do this about 4 times a year. Big fight no longer friends 2 weeks later they are back to being besties. 

It came time to picking out dresses and she had forgotten I got a tattoo on my shoulder. It isn't atrocious. It doesn't have any satanic or religious meaning. It's a constellation. And she pointed out how it didn't fit the look she wanted of her wedding. So I suggested tattoo make up. This wasn't enough as it would run off on her or stain the chairs or something. She wanted me in a different dress so I asked which one. I pointed out the tat wouldn't be covered in that dress either and she said we'd  add tattoo makeup to it. You see where that is going? So I just said whatever and left it at that. 

About 2 weeks later she texted me cutting me out of her wedding to save our friendship. This is when I lost it. I told her I wasn't her other friends that she could push around like this, cut out of things and expect them to be happy with whatever it was she was happy with at the time. I brought up how condescending she is when she says things like ""honey"" or ""sweetie"" at the beginning of a sentence and started using it to show her how bad it sounded. I brought up how she uses money to make me feel like shit. And yet she is complaining about purchasing a 350k dollar home as her first home. And this all ended with me saying I was done. She has tried contacting me twice since. Both times I have been completely drunk.

 Now my job is kind of flexible, as in I can take breaks to get stuff done or whatever, but obviously then I would have to make up those hours later in the day. I prefer to work 8-4, and just be done, unless I have an appointment or something that really needs attention.

He will barge in my office to show me and article he found (usually about football or whatever), or to ask for a handjob, or when I’m going to make lunch, whatever. Not life threatening important stuff. I have told him so many times to not come in the room, or at least knock so I can lock my computer before he comes in, but he doesn’t listen.

I've known this is his plan for a while, but he called my wife last night and told her about it, as well.

This is the guy who told my wife (now of almost five years) that she was ruining her life by marrying me. The guy who, as I've learned through helping my wife get in to therapy and deal with her childhood traumas, is at the root of her issues because he was mentally and emotionally abusive to her for twenty years. The guy who, when our nephew tells him to put him down because he's scared, says, ""No you aren't - you're having fun."" He's never hit anyone, but he's very controlling and demeaning to everyone in the family.

Side point: BIL has this idea that if he tells me something, I'm not allowed to tell her, and vice versa. (Everyone in the family knows that it doesn't work that way, but we humor him as much as we can.)

Anyway, when he and I had talked about this previously, I told him that I wouldn't be able to go to his wedding three time zones away, because I can't afford it and, given the date that he has chosen, I can't get anyone to cover my work if I were gone - in addition to having no paid time off to use for such an event.

So last night, he calls my wife and talks to her. She gets off the phone, tells me what he had said - all of which I already knew and had told her anyway - but adds that he wants us there and that he will ""make it work"" because it's what he wants for his wedding, presumably by paying for our travel expenses.

Now, I respect that he wants to include his family in his special day. I appreciate his generosy.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over 5 months now. Early in our relationship I borrowed a pair of his favorite sweatpants and have been holding on to them over since. They are super cozy and he was alright with me keeping them since I loved them so much and had every intention of giving them back. I have always put in an effort to take care of them and not eat any messy food in them since I know they are not mine. 

However, over the weekend I caught one of those 24 hours stomach bugs. I was feeling a little woozy and decided to spend the night in. Everything was going alright but then the worst case scenario happened and I dashed for the bathroom. I, unfortunately, didn’t make it and ended up messing myself. I don’t want to get into gross detail but about the 1/3 of the sweatpants were damaged. I stripped them off and tossed them outside on my front stoop to deal with later since I wasn’t in the condition to deal with them then and there. The next 20 or so hours I was tied to the bathroom and spent the whole time on the bathroom floor. The next day I went to go deal with the sweatpants and they had attracted flies and were, what I saw, as a lost cause. They were a lighter grey color and I just didn’t know how much could be done so I wrapped them in a plastic bag and threw them away.

My boyfriend knew I was sick at the time but I didn’t tell him about the sweatpants until a few days later when I saw him face to face. He was extremely angry and wanted to know why I didn’t try to save them. I don’t think he realized how horrifying their condition was but he still said I should have tried. It turns out those sweatpants were more sentimental than I realized which is my mistake. They also cost more than I anticipated(~$70) which makes me feel terrible.

bha6u1,1556207285,AITA for helping to prank my daughter's husband with a macabre dark-web mystery box?,"This was a long-running April Fool's prank that went too far, but I don't see the response as equal to the injury.

&#x200B;

Our daughter came to us, asking if we would help with a dark-web mystery box charade that she wanted to play on her husband. This was inspired by many of the YouTube 'unboxing' videos that you see, with the same theme. We agreed, and she told her husband earlier in the month that she'd purchased one from a dark-web marketplace. (This would be unlikely, if you knew her.) She said she wanted to make a YouTube video of the unboxing.

&#x200B;

Over the following week, my wife and I collected some creepy items to put in the 'mystery box':

&#x200B;

\- We grilled steaks, and put bloody butcher's paper in a zip-lock bag, with some cheap earrings.

\- We put a chunk of fat from the steak in a sealed bottle.

\- We put our daughter's baby teeth in a little pouch.

\- We added some metallic 'murder weapon-y' thing.

&#x200B;

That's the gist of it. Then we drove out of state and mailed it. It was 'supposed' to go to her work address, but we mailed it to her home address, as it was creepier.

&#x200B;

Over the next ten days, the husband was increasingly nervous about the whole affair. My wife and I don't live near them, so we didn't see this firsthand. Our daughter and her husband work opposite shifts, too, so they weren't spending time together. Eventually the box arrived, and it sat for a day in their kitchen, until they had a chance to open it together. We thought it would be sooner than it was, fwiw.

&#x200B;

Understand, my wife loves creepy things. She was very eager to have them open it. Her enthusiasm got the best of her, I think, and we definitely went too far by sending 'creep' emails to the daughter and the husband from a throw away account. Nothing NSFW, but kind of lewd.

&#x200B;

Last night was the great unboxing, and the husband was accepting this thing as the real deal. He was getting more and more freaked out, so we told him, it was just a ruse.

&#x200B;

He was furious. We immediately realized that it had gone too far, and we were quick to acknowledge and accept responsibility for that, but he wouldn't even hear it. He flew into a rage, verbally abusing our daughter. His mother was angry texting my wife.

&#x200B;

Our daughter had to go to a hotel. He punched a hole in their door. Her credit card wouldn't work, so we suspect that he took her name off of their joint account. His father wrote to the daughter and said that if my wife and I were behind this, he wants nothing to do with us ever again.

&#x200B;

My wife is sick with regret, but we never anticipated this response. Apart from apologizing, what do we say? 'April Fool'? We're genuinely sorry, but his reaction seems so over-the-top. The harsh criticism coming from his parents, supportive and compassionate to the husband, seem to validate what we see as his overreaction. We fully expect this to end their marriage.

We have lived in apartments our entire adult lives.  Top floor, bottom floor, u name it, and we are used to and understanding of the noise. 

Moving to a duplex was a large step up for us. Each kid has their own room now! We have a garage! A backyard! We can grill! Also, it costs way more in rent then we have ever spent. But it seemed worth it, better school district and all that. 

Then real life set in and it hit hard. It’s almost like clock work, every night around 8-8:30ish the pounding and screaming starts. And it continued every night past 10:00 for quite awhile. 

About two weeks in it became ridiculous. My children were having a hard time falling asleep and it would go late enough that even my wife and I would have trouble going to sleep. One night it was exceptionally bad and my wife and I had had it! I knocked politely and the dad answered. 

I calmly explained to him that the noise was really loud, and that I wanted to have open communication with him because I’m sure they hear my kids at times too. He responded by saying, no, they never hear us and admitted it was all them. Then stated that one of their four children had autism and then nonchalantly jotted down my phone number and texted me for future use. 

Since then we haven’t heard anything past 10pm, (quiet hours are 10pm-8am) but every night there is pounding and screaming, every god damn night! And every god damn night my children have difficulty falling asleep! 

Since then we have filed multiple complaints with our rental agency, showing videos of even, of how loud it is and they don’t seem to care. They have done absolutely nothing. It’s so bad we are wanting to break our lease a month and a half in so we can, once again, have peace. 

Tonight it was a bit worse than usual and I texted the dad to ask if he would consider moving the loud child to a room that doesnt share a wall. I havnt heard back and I don’t expect to.

J gets really triggered if anyone even mentions anything relating to gay around him, so me and A had planned to make the diss track mostly us calling J gay.

Skip forword a few days, our teacher gets a call from guidance ""You and A are going to guidance"" (not actually what was said). The guidance asks us our side of the story, we explain what happened to her. The guidance made me and A apologize to J, so we did.

I am 25 and I've been dating my girlfriend (24) for almost 5 years. Since the beginning, my mom has disapproved of our relationship, mainly because my girlfriend is a different religion than my family, and also because of some health issues my girlfriend has suffered from in the past. My mom is not particularly religious, but is very serious about only marrying within the religion. I've always thought this was mostly about her belief that people of other religions were inferior, which she expressed to me and my brother often during our childhoods. This became increasingly problematic as our relationship became serious and we now live together.  Over these 5 years, my relationship with my mother deteriorated because of this and now we don't speak at all. We had a big fight about my girlfriend on my birthday last December and stopped speaking then. I  tried to call her to wish her Happy Birthday in March but she ignored my call. I also tried to reach out on Mothers day and she answered the phone but quickly hung up on me. I am planning on marrying my girlfriend probably in the near future so I don't think there is any resolution to this issue.

So it really angers me that there are like 5 people around my block who have much larger, much more aggressive dogs, and refuse to use a leash.

&#x200B;

This morning was the last straw, their dog was out on an open yard (no fencing, no shrubbery just an open yard) and it bounded at me and my dogs the moment it saw us, growling and barking. I stepped in front of it, to protect my dogs, and yelled at it. The dog did not stop until it's owner had to tackle it to the ground.

I told the owner that if they didn't keep the dog on the leash the next time this happened I would be calling the RCMP and having it put down. My hope is that they put the dog on a leash and it's a threat I never have to go through with, but with how many times this has happened I'm starting to think that it's something I am just gonna have to do the next time their dog runs at me.

However, over the last year, there have been 4 instances in which I was overpaid due to clerical errors/ incompetence on behalf of my employer and each time I have notified them and had to pay them back. 

Last Friday I logged into my 401k account and noticed they had overpaid me (by several thousand dollars) into this account (the previous overpayments had been to my checking account). I am worried that if I tell them I will have to withdrawal the money and be responsible for taxes and penalties.

ci8ga6,1564174899,WIBTA for calling the cops on people parked in handicapped spots?,"Okay, I figured since I saw a similar post about a bus on here, I’d get your opinion.

There is a new restaurant in my neighborhood that opened a few months ago, and apparently their parking lot is too small (this place is pretty small, so I’m not sure how all these people fit in there anyway). There is no street parking in front, but there is on the side street next to it (it’s on a corner). On the other side of this side street is a post office building and it has about 5 designated short-time (15 min) parking spots along the side of the building on the side street, and the signs have no time restrictions, like if it was just during business hours. They also have a parking lot behind the building, and there are handicapped spots in this lot and there are often people without handicapped tags/plates parking there, even though there are plenty of other spots in this lot.

So, WIBTA if, the next time I saw people parking in those spots, I called the cops and reported it? I’m not sure, because it’s usually after the post office is closed, but it’s not like there aren’t any other spots in that parking lot, it’s almost never more than 1/4th full, it just seems like they’re being lazy because those spots are closet to the restaurant.",False,not the asshole,5,22,0
dhf6ig,1570994663,WIBTA if I slipped a rude note under my neighbors door?,"Hello, 

So for reference I have been living in my current apartment building since February. The unit next to ours was empty for the first two months or so, then a couple moved in. Ever since they moved in, they’ve been obnoxious. I’m convinced neither of them work and that the woman is not on the lease, as all they do is blare music and cackle loudly at all hours of the day. They frequently take turns locking each other out and banging on the door for hours to be let in. They throw things around and yell at each other late at night. 

We finally reached out to the on-site land lady, who said this behavior was unacceptable. Things quieted down for awhile, they still played music loudly but I kinda brushed it off as I’m sure we have done noisy things too. Can’t expect them to be silent all the time. 

So, another relevant point is that I have PTSD with recurring nightmares about people entering my apartment/room. It causes me a lot of anxiety, to the point where I obsess about the door being locked. 

Last night our *lovely* neighbors started banging on our door and yelling to be let in at 3:30 am. This immediately triggered a panic attack for me and I woke up my partner in bed while hyperventilating. I was terrified as they relentlessly knocked and called out a name that wasn’t mine or my partners. My boyfriend got up to go near the door which made me feel worse. I kept repeating “don’t open don’t open don’t open!” He said through the door “I think you have the wrong apartment”, and he heard the one next to us open their door. I don’t know if they heard us or if the one next door heard the yelling, but either way it stopped after that. The confusing thing is that in my building you need a fob to get in, up the elevator/stairs, and then a key for each unit. How did these people get in this early in the morning without the unit owner waiting for them or getting them from the lobby? 

I have been a wreck all day since. I’m jittery and still feeling triggered. My partner is tempted to slip a note under their door, saying something like “Don’t knock on our door at 3am ASSHOLE!” 

Would we be the assholes if we did that? I’m just not sure what else the building management can do if they’ve been warned once and won’t listen.",False,not the asshole,155,35,0
csdu8u,1566200474,AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to visit my school?,"So I’m in my senior year of highschool and my boyfriend is a sophomore in college, but he still hasn’t started for the year so he’s still back in our hometown.

Now my boyfriend is super duper carefree. Doesn’t care at all what other people think, does what he wants. I admire that from him sometimes.

Me on the otherhand, I’m the biggest people pleaser. I do what makes me happy, of course, but I also consider how other people might perceive what I do.

Anyways, recently we had our Senior Sunrise and my boyfriend came along. He didn’t just come for me; he came for our friend group who he’s also pretty close with. Afterwards we went to go eat and he dropped me off at school. 

He said he’d walk me to class, but he actually went further and stayed in my first period. He went to the same highschool as me so he knew most of the teachers already, so it wasn’t super weird. But some of my friends in that class joked around that it wasn’t “Bring Your Boyfriend to School” day.

I felt pretty embarrassed about it, I won’t lie. My boyfriend came on his own accord, but the way everything was happening it made it seem like I just randomly brought him in 2 years after he graduated.

He stayed until the end of 2nd period but he went our friends’ 2nd, not mine. He left soon after the end because his mom needed something.

Now he’s making plans of going again unannounced and staying for the whole day if possible. I was honest and told him that I’d feel weird if he came in again because I feel like people were already judging me for bringing him along, especially if now he’s coming in unannounced.

He assured me that it was fine that I felt weird and that he’d instead go to another friends’ period and we’d just see eachother whenever.

d5gvki,1568726376,Aita for wanting to find a new home for our puppy?,"Myself (M) and my girlfriend have been living together for about 4 years, we've had 2 cats together for this entire time and 2 months ago we decided to try a puppy (more my decision) 

My friend was basically giving away some German Shepherd pups and I decided to take one.

I instantly fell in love while my girlfriend hated her for for the first month. It was alot of work on my part to train, cleanup and take care of the pup but she's really become a gem. Main problem is the cats, they absolutely hate the new puppy and have not been dealing with the change well. I feel for them so much and the guilt is making me really have a hard time being with the pup. My girlfriend left for a 4 week trip with a friend last week, and it's been total hell at home trying to manage everything, the puppy is getting bigger, the cats are even more depressed, and my workload has become crazy.

In a moment of desperation i put it out there that I may be looking for a new home for our pup, and I got a response from someone who is absolutely ideal for the job. A total dog lover who is looking for an adventure partner. I can't imagine a better home for our girl.

My girlfriend is now extremely upset and sad that I'm looking to do this while she's gone, even though she gives 0 effort into the dogs maintainence and training.

clyk5b,1564937644,AITA for my anger of being ridiculed for being a single dad,"Oh boy. This is a very long story, and there are two parts. I need to know if I'm an asshole on both.

Part 1: Kayleigh, my daughter, is fourteen. Now, at this point, she has come out as bisexual. She had plenty of friends and hung out with them outside of school plenty of times. Her friend group had both guys and girls and she was very close with all of them. One day she asked if her friend Anna could sleepover. Why not? Anna came over, she had a great time, no problem here. So... when she asked if her friend Nick could sleepover, I saw no problem with it. And just like with Anna, they had a great time. Nick's parents also didn't seem to have an issue with this, so I thought nothing of it. OH BOY was I wrong. All of the parents in our community (it's a small town we all know each other) were ridiculing me and telling me I was a foolish parent for letting this happen. Now, at this point I was in contact with all these people, we weren't really friends but I still knew them all. I didn't understand because... she's bi? And also she had a female friend sleepover and nobody cared? So what the hell was the problem? After this, I decided to cut ties with most of these people. I just don't see the issue with it and these other parents were being EXTREMELY rude about my choice to let my daughter have guys over. So, people of Reddit, AITA for cutting these people off for being rude to me about my choice to let my daughter have guys sleepover?

Part 2: I've never been a strict parent. My daughter was pretty much allowed to do whatever as long as it wasn't illegal. I have always faced ridicule for being a single dad, there seems to be a stigma that I just won't do a good job. But Kayleigh herself believes I have. So I learned to tune out the idiots. But, when she turned 18, it was starting to weigh on me. Then came graduation. I was there when I overheard the other parents talking about how several kids had been arrested for being in possession of marijuana. Now, when I walked over and asked about it, the main parent talking about it turned to me and no joke said, ""Why do you want to know? You're probably the one supplying the kids with marijuana considering the fact that you are ok with your kid having sex at 14."" I was in shock, I had seen this woman before, she was married and didn't have to raise her kid alone. This made it all come boiling out. Everything else I've said in this post, everything I'd had to deal with over the years of being insulted for being a single dad. I told her I wasn't a stuck up bitch and didn't care what my daughter did in her spare time as long as it wasn't illegal. My daughter left with her girlfriend after the graduation was done, and I drove home. I knew they would be out all night, and when I got home, I started crying. I just couldn't handle it anymore. Kayleigh says she understands and doesn't care that I yelled at that woman for what she said. But, she's always been on my side. So, people of Reddit, AITA for yelling at that woman?

Edit: Thank you all for the support, it has been nice knowing I was in the right, and I do agree I shouldn't have lost my cool the way I did. I should also mention I actually adopted Kayleigh, she isn't my biological daughter. I think I'll post about my experiences with adopting a child in the future.

Edit 2: Ok I just realized I messed up in my post. I need to make it clear that my daughter WAS NOT having sex at 14. She was just having a sleepover with a guy, that doesn't mean they are having sex.

Edit 3: So it seems that some people got the wrong idea. Again, I will reiterate that my daughter wasn't having sex at 14 years old. She was actually dating a girl at the time when she had Nick sleepover.",1565006659.0,not the asshole,106,58,0

Not a chance - this kids has severe ADHD and needs constant supervision and validation.

John is a brilliant kid. Super smart, very well behaved, does great in school, etc. Really, I couldn't ask for a better child. But, much like his old man, he's a bit of a nerd, and he has a bit of ADD/ADHD. We don't medicate him, he doesn't see a therapist, he just gets bored easily and sometimes has trouble focusing.

John sucks at baseball, but honestly I could care less about that. We practice, but it's just obviously not his thing. It wasn't a big deal up until this point because all the kids were kind of bad, but this year you can tell it's getting more competitive, and the gap is more obvious.

  


The problem, which is obvious to me but not to John, is that he doesn't like the game. On the field he looks bored out of his mind. He complains (loudly) about how long it's taking, and he has missed several plays because he wasn't paying attention. He also frequently gets yelled at for talking in the dugout or even on the field.

This area seems to work great for the dogs (occasional whimpering)...until one of the in-laws INSISTS on bringing the dogs out of that gated area. My mother-in-law babysits occasionally and knows the dogs are to stay in the gated area. Each time I have come home to find that she had let the dogs out at some point and there is pee on the carpet. I told mother-in-law about this and she seemed apologetic, but it continues to happen. I do not want to ruin this great relationship and occasional babysitting we have with them. I want to say the dogs cannot come over again, but these are their ""kids"", and I worry they would never come over again. AITA?",False,not the asshole,14,28,0
avduw5,1551276508,AITA if I collect my neighbor's unpicked dog shit and put in on their car or doorstep?,"A neighbor got a dog a few months.  It's a cute little puppy and it seems the dog is the responsibility of the neighbors son who is about 12-14.  I don't know this neighbor, I didn't even know they existed until the dog appeared.  Well, recently I noticed piles of dog shit on another neighbor's lawn.  Then after a few days it was all be gone and the cycle started again. I don't know who is cleaning it up. It could be the dog owner is picking it up every couple days or it could be the home owner is.  I don't even know if the home owner minds. For some reason, this is driving me crazy.  I walk my dog past the poop lawn every day and my dog likes to pee in this area. I don't want my neighbors to think this is my dog's shit. I almost (more on that later) always pick up after my dog. 

&#x200B;

So here is where I need you help:  My dog is a super good boy but for some reason he will not go to the bathroom in our small backyard.  I live in a place with an HOA and there are common grounds throughout our neighborhood (in fact the front lawn where the neighbor's dog is shitting is technically common ground but we all treat our front lawns as our own).  Sometimes as night I will let my dog out and he will run to a common area that no one ever goes to and shit.  He usually does it in the woods so it's not a big deal but I'm sure he has also done it in the common space.  Usually it will just get mowed up by the landscapers.  I go into this common area quiet often and have never seen anyone else in there and have only seen my dog's shit once or twice and I pick it up when do.

&#x200B;

Am I an asshole hypocrite if I take vengeance?  Is my indignation righteous?  I feel the circumstances are different because they are letting their dog shit in space that everyone sees near their neighbor's house.  Also, they are walking their dog when it happens.  They are right there, just pick it up.  I used to pick it for them just so I didn't have to deal with HOA blow back but I got sick of that real fast.

d52yq0,1568650812,AITA for asking my husband to cancel a trip that he secretly planned to Europe with his brother?,"My husband’s brother recently moved to town with his wife and they have become our go-to hangout buddies for EVERYTHING. My husband even set up his at home office at their house (they now live 5 minutes down the street). Over the last few years my husband and I have racked up 50k in CC debt between our wedding, our businesses, and buying a fixer upper home. This was discussed, and I’ve been working lots of long hours to get back in the black. The payoff is I just landed a series of big (time sensitive) projects that my husband and I plan to do together, that will go a long way toward getting us back on track financially.

Last week we were at a pool party and I overheard him and his brother talking about how cheap their tickets are for their trip to Europe. I swim over and ask, “What trip?”. His brother mumbles something like ‘oh sh\*t’. My husband paused, then jovially says they planned a trip to Europe in October. Right in the middle of our job. Not wanting to make a scene I quietly left the pool and went inside. My husband followed me and a heated discussion ensued. He said his brother was going to pay the plane fare since we were having trouble financially. I explained that not only was he bailing on me for our upcoming project, but things like 9 day trips to Europe shouldn’t be kept a secret from your wife. He agreed to cancel the trip and apologized. That night he’s on the phone with his brother and tells him to cancel the tickets… but 10 min later he strolls in and says they still want to go and I’m being controlling. Now this is a gentleman who just went with his brother to Las Vegas in the middle of the work week while I was stuck in town working last month. As it stands he can do WHATEVER he wants, as long as he TELLS me first.

After a second long discussion he again agrees to cancel the trip. Then his brother starts texting me with excuses. First it’s that want to see their mom who lives there who they haven’t seen in years. I suggested flying her here and having her stay with us so I can also meet her. Bonus: half the price. Nope.  Next was that my husband is ‘depressed’. Well, the four of us just got back from 9 days in Iceland that we couldn’t afford. Not sure why THIS trip would make it better if that didn’t help. I suggested therapy, not plane tickets, but that goes nowhere. 

It’s now been a week since I’ve seen his brother and wife. The usual fun group text between all of us is dead. I hear his friends are telling him I’m overbearing and that his brother is ‘saving him from me’. I’ve made an appointment with a couples therapist for us, but in the meantime I feel like I’m going nuts and the tension is getting worse.

brjrv4,1558495373,AITA for refusing my best friend rides,"For context we're both college students I'm 21 and she's 19. We go to the same college and also are working on a summer project together. Our relationship has been pretty good and we're a pretty good match. Recently, like about a month ago, her brother got in an accident with HER car and it was really serious. He had to go to the hospital and is taking the guy to court. Her car is completely totaled and she no longer had no way to get around except to share her brother's car or have her mom pick her up. I was fine with driving her and me to get lunch in between classes or giving her rides after class.

Last weekend we took a field day and I asked everyone to meet at my house so we can get to our destination which was an hour away. She refused and said she's too lazy to get a ride so I had to pick her up which is 20 minutes away from me in the opposite direction. I said whatever and did it, then we got to the destination.  We spent the day in the park and I drove back home she didn't have a ride to her place and expected me to drop her off after spending 8 hours together. I told her I couldn't I had no gas and she said: ""Go fill it up"". Eventually, we voted to drop everyone at my house. Fast forward to this week we're working on a summer art project for our city. I drive to the area and I saw her there. Once our work ended she asked me for a ride, my house was 20 minutes away plus her house 20 more minutes and the trip back so I rolled my eyes and said ""Really?"".  I agreed since I didn't want to say no at the moment.

bafh58,1554637740,WIBTA if I tell my husband I don’t want to go the play he bought us tickets for.,"Quick background: I love the theater. I acted in high school and college and if I believed it was a realistic pursuit I might still be doing it today. Since college I have been a near constant patron of theater. I met my husband after college and he doesn’t quite get why I like it so much but he does encourage it and when it’s a gift giving occasion I can usually expect theater tickets for both of us. I am very grateful for them and all he does for me. We have a great relationship and I am very happy. It makes me even happier when he gets into theater which he did for a couple plays/musicals we’ve seen like Hamilton, Rent, Avenue Q, and Macbeth. I have tried to return the favor by trying to understand football (U.S) and rooting for his team.

A few days ago my husband, on a non-gift giving occasion, surprised me at dinner with an envelope he slid across the table and he said “I hope you don’t have plans for next Friday.” I was absolutely giddy as I opened it up. However when I opened it was tickets for Taming of the Shrew. I said thank you because of his feelings and his thought was in the right place. I asked him if he knew what the play was about and he said “No, but it’s Shakespeare.” I think he could tell my excitement had died quite a bit but he didn’t say anything.

I personally find the play very objectionable and misogynistic for the way Katherine is treated and especially the final speech at the end. I know most theater companies have tried to change it to something ironic for the sake of modern sensibilities but I still find the very idea of the play to be something that troubles me and something I would be very uncomfortable sitting through. That said I love my husband and appreciate all he does for me so I’m not sure if I should go just to not hurt his feelings.

dcsxtn,1570118634,WIBTA if I end a 10 yr friendship?,"I have a friend Rosie and I want to end our friendship and I don’t know if that's an asshole move. 

Rosie is 13 years older than me and she helped me through my younger dumber years. She is disabled and can’t work so I would always go to her house and hang out. She taught me how to cook, how to speak fluent Spanish, and also gave me many items in my home. I never asked for anything she gave them to me but they are very nice expensive pieces.

For many years Rosie has been going down a bad path. First, she separated from her husband I nudged her to get back with her husband cus they had 2 kids together. The second separation I tried to distract her. I was older so I took her out, we got wine, invited her to parties. One time I invited her to a party with about 5 other women, everything was going well, we were playing a board game, she accused the host of cheating, got mad, and left.

She started dating a guy that did hard drugs, she ended up getting pregnant by him and he took off, then she got back with her husband. While she was pregnant her mother passes and she left Rosie a lot of money, and a house. 

Then she decided to start a non-profit organization to try and save the planet. Before she got started I asked her “are you going to put any money aside for your kids for college or something like that” and her answer was “no”.

She made a FB post about how her oldest was 10 yr old. She homeschools I asked “how are his study’s” she responded with “I do education through experiences not force, so when I am baking a cake we learn about fractions and that is how he learns” I looked it up in my state basically if she says she is homeschooling him, the state will not do anything to regulate what the student is taught.

A few days ago she told me the county is coming after her because she has not paid her taxes in 2 years. I asked her “ what are you going to do” and she just replied “sell my house” we went back and forth for a good while about how I thought she should sell the property her mother gave her to pay for the taxes on her house. She came up with excuses about how it was other people’s fault for not giving her money and how she needs a new man in her life that will pay for all of this and how that her mother's house was for her non-profit. I asked “where are you and your kids going to live if you sell your house” and she just said, “idk I will figure it out”.

Now I am much older and IDK if she was always this way and I just didn’t see it or if it’s been getting worse.

I honestly don't think she heard me, but we were talking about a friend at the time and she asks for me to text his number to her. I say yeah, and then repeat can she just take a step back because she smelled of smoke. Melody says that she will take a step away if I just text her the number. I get peeved right then because I have asked twice and I tell her I will send her the number if she takes a step or two back. She says I'm being mean and doesn't understand why I can't give it to her right then. I say I don't understand why she can't take a step back anyway, because I'm texting her the number, it's not like I have to physically hand it to her. Melody says that if I had just given her the number to begin with she would've walked away. I tell her that was unlikely since 1) we were in the middle of a conversation and we only knew each other there and 2) she wasn't going to call him, she hates talking on the phone and it was 11 at night, he's probably sleeping. The most she was going to do was text him. She says nothing to this and we're both obviously annoyed and she still refuses to move away so I put my phone back in my pocket. She vows to follow me around for the rest of the night. There's literally like thirty seconds of silence between us before our other friend, Brant, comes and notices the tension, and Melody immediately tells him that we had a fight because ""FeonixPheathers is being a douchebag and won't give me So&So's number because he says I smell like smoke."" Brant doesn't even listen for my side, but for the rest of the night they call me a douchebag and make jokes that people shouldn't smoke near me since I'm a cigarette nazi.

Honestly, we made up like a minute after that altercation, but it's been eating at me because she said I was being rude by asking her to step away. Was I the asshole?

EDIT: In fairness, I would have stepped a way myself, but I was sitting down in a crowded bar when she came in and she was standing which is why I didn't think it was a big deal for her to just take a step back.

6 months ago one of my husbands friends became an insurance agent on the side, and she wanted my husband to do it too.

Neither I nor my husband was really into that, and the ""fee"" to start being an agent was about $200. I told husband it wasnt worth the money, and he agreed. We said no thank you. But his friend REALLY wanted my husband to work for her so she paid the fine. 

Husband said ok, they gave him the dumb packets and stuff. But he already worked full time elsewhere so it wasnt a priority for us. Eventually we just kinda let it go, we had other stuff going on.

The friend wont stop bugging my husband about getting new clients for her. In the last 3 months, we have moved and he quit his job to work part time and go to college full time. I'm not working anymore since I'm hella pregnant and due in a few weeks. 

Still, she keeps bugging us for appointments with new clients. Etc. Hes told her he hasnt had time but she keeps bugging.

A few days ago she texts him and says he either needs to get him a new client or he has to pay her back that stupid fee from 6 months ago. The fee I was VERY CLEAR about not paying bc we didnt care enough to be an agent for this stupid company.

My view is that I dont owe her the money. Shes only demanding it bc shes trying to squeeze money out of us. She took a gamble that my husband would get her a ton of clients. It didnt pan out and now she wants it back, when it was clearly a gift. 

My husband feels super guilty and wants to pay her the money. His friend isnt very nice, and she even had her boss at the company send my husband a bunch of messages telling him what a schmuck he is and blah blah blah. Super unprofessional.

My nephew has a habit of eating very slowly because he gets distracted watching the cartoon on TV, which our family put on to keep the younger kid entertained so his mom can eat with the family. His parents constantly tell him to focus on his dinner whether he does it, but he just ends up going back to doing it anyway and almost always finish his dinner last after everyone else.

Tonight I noticed him doing it again constantly, so I told him ""whoever finishes dinner last has to do the dishes"" (and it's a family dinner with an additional family guest, so a loooooot of dishes). Both my parents and his parents (my brother and SIL) agreed with me, but when it came time to actually do the dishes he whined and pouted so my dad let him off the hook and decided to do the dishes himself. My mom told me to help him with it, I replied that nephew should be helping his grandfather instead, and she said ""he's the nephew, cut him some slack"".

I have no idea how my brother and SIL discipline him, but he has a tendency to pout to try and get out of trouble, with varying levels of success; it seems to work more often on my parents (his grandparents).

Am I just being the asshole aunt stereotype here?  

Edit: Some people are asking why it's important for him to finish his dinner quickly.

The week before Christmas, I received a $400 target gift card I won in a drawing.  I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, “You have to get something for me and (Sister’s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) 

Then when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. 

Mom: “Oh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1’s name) and (Cousin 2’s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don’t just get something cheap.” She said, even more obnoxiously 

(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don’t and won’t see often?)

Me: “No thanks.” I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom’s texts and phone calls. (Keep in mind that I was already frustrated from the fact that my mom was being super needy about it, and her telling me to get more stuff for more people didn’t help it at all.)

I spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. 

Walked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) 

We were arguing then I just said “Maybe if you weren’t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn’t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!” (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) 

She then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. 

Typing that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I’m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only.

However, in January 2019 she decided to quit her job to start a business and drives Uber to make income. Now, she wants me to start paying half the rent as well because she says she doesn't make enough money to do anything.

And I know it, that isn't why I'm second-guessing myself. There is more to it. Also, i want to thank you for taking your time to read my case in advance, i appreciate it.

So, essentially, let's say there's this girl who used to like me before, I had rejected her a few times because overall she just isn't my type. She's pretty and all, but I don't like her personality that much. Now, she once revealed to me she liked me and wanted a relationship a few years ago, but I politely declined. She didn't talk to me for a while but we were still friends, and we ended up talking even more. Fast forward a few years later (now it's February from 2019), and she invited me to go to a sports convention (where you exercise) in a hotel. I was like ""sure"" and went with her. She ended up exercising and I just waited because I arrived a bit late (not on purpose, traffic) so we decided to go to the pool.

Now, here's where the interesting part comes. While at the pool, she all of a sudden torpedoed at me, hugged me and kissed me. I was shocked, but I liked it (I had broken up with my ex a few months back and hadn't kissed a girl until then, at least not sober). It felt nice, but I didn't feel anything emotionally related. I stopped the kiss but she continued. To save you some trouble, let's say we ended up deciding we were gonna have sex.

But, the thing is, and I'm not gonna lie and pretend to be the nice guy, but I kinda had the impression she still liked me. Why is this a problem? Because I feel I let my own pleasure potentially send off a misinterpreted sign. Now, I also have to clear up I NEVER hinted as to me liking her, nor that the sex was gonna start any relationship. I thought it was clear it was just casual woohoo, but a few days later she texted me asking if I wanted to go out with her.

Me, not knowing she meant an actual date and not wanting to be rude, I said ""sure"". I didn't go out with her though, a day before our ""date"" I asked her: ""hey, I want to have something clear, is this a romantic date or a friends hangout?"" She said ""it's a date, you idiot"" (we get along with insults). But I didn't want that, so I cancelled the date (politely, obviously). I then said we could still go but as friends only, then she proceeded to insult me and never spoke to me again.

I also have to mention, we had sex in a motel, which costs money. I didn't have any so I told her I'd pay her later, so she paid the room. Thing is, I never gave her the money back, because she stopped talking to me.

Essentially, I wanna know if ITA in three things:

1. Sex even if I assumed she probably still liked me
2. Declining the date a day before
3. Not paying her back (take into consideration, she stopped talking to me and insulted me)

The three siblings in question had all chosen to stop speaking to her and since I took her side, cut me off as well. Realistically I could only get in contact with one of them easily (have one's phone number, did have another's address), but I feel he would tell the others. For some additional info, my sister is a bit psycho - as in pulling her own hair out, completely believes things she has made up in her mind - and I don't know what she would do to try to annoy/torture me or my stepdad afterwards.

For a year I have kept this secret and while I feel guilty for not telling them, I keep remembering the promise I made to my mother.

After that, we all get sat down, introduce the dogs, etc. I had been playing video games but came out to be polite and greet them and see what my dog was freaking out over.

This is where the issue arises.

My cousin then says she wants a Starbucks and asks where it is. I start describing where our local Safeway is, which has the Starbucks. I also live in a VERY small town. Mid-description she cuts me off and says, ""no, you're not going to tell me where it is. You're going to take me and get it for me."" To which I just stare at her in disbelief. I've never met this women before and she comes into MY house and demands that I drive and buy her Starbucks with the little money I have within 5 minutes of meeting me. After I stared at her I just left.

Fast forward about 15 min and my grandmother comes into my room, asking again that I take her to Starbucks so she'll shut up since she obviously doesn't like her either. I said no because she was extremely rude and demanding, and that I would've had no problem taking her if she would've just asked politely (and didn't demand that I pay for it.) My grandma then says that I'm being just as rude and leaves. 

I told my mom and she had the same reaction that I did but later said I should've taken her when my grandma asked, despite my cousin being extremely busy. Am I the asshole for not taking my cousin to Starbucks when my grandma asked?

Also relevant; I can be kind of socially oblivious. 

I was at my sister's wedding when my cousin Sam who is 18 and wants to study CS, and his parents, came up to me to ask me for advice about school.

They wanted to know what kind of computer an and other supplies I'd recommend, and I said that I've been happy using my 2012 MacBook Air throughout all of college and grad school; it was tiny enough to throw in my purse or small backpack and go to class, and it was reliable as anything.

 And I'd recommend always looking for a PDF or digital copy of books before spending hundreds on paper copies. PDFs can be searched through way easier, marked up without losing value, etc. I also recommend getting durable notebooks like Moleskine brand, and taking good handwritten notes. Because I still find myself referring to my notes from college at work sometimes.

Sam said something about how Mac Airs aren't powerful at all, how they're more of a fashion laptop than a practical one. Which came off as kind of rude.

His dad asked about the computer, ""don't you need something more powerful for programming?"" And I was like ""Nah, programming is really just writing text to a file. And as for running code; normal undergrad projects aren't gonna be resource intensive enough to be a problem. Unless you're writing hella inefficient code."" 

Sam was like ""You're still using that old mac for your Master's?"" And I said yeah, I code on there and then compile and run on a separate server that's for computer vision processing.

Anyway, later that night, Sam came up to me, mad at me for having inadvertently talked his parents out of buying him the top of the line Alienware laptop he wanted. He was supposed to be getting a laptop as a ""going to school"" gift and he wanted that one.

So I guess when I talked about using a ""shitty"" laptop for school, and doing fine with it, it convinced them they didn't need to get him the Alienware laptop. 

I feel kind of bad for not realizing what was going on.

i was walking my dog because i’d just gotten back from class and she’d been waiting for me for a few hours. my apartment building has a ramp leading up to the entrance to the elevator, so rather than make my poor old girl walk up two flights of stairs, i usually use the elevator to get to my floor so she doesn’t have to. when i got to the entrance, there were some cars parked in the guest spots and i heard Some Guy (SG for convenience purposes) shouting something. i figured it was at someone else, since we just moved here and i don’t really know anyone in my building, but apparently he was talking to me. as soon as i use my key fob to get into the lobby, he starts shouting again.

SG: hey!! HEY!! can you stay out there with him for a minute?!

Me: (turning to see a kid about 9-ish) oh, no, i can’t.

SG: it’s just a minute! i’m going in here, i need you to stay with him!

his body language was pretty aggressive, and i have terrible anxiety, so him yelling all this at me was making me pretty uncomfortable.

Me: no. excuse me. (i start to walk towards the elevator, but he moves in front of me)

SG: why can’t you just stay out there with him, huh?! it’s only for a minute! just stay out there with him!

at this point, my dog is getting just about as upset as me—tail low, ears pulled back—so now i’m angry in addition to being anxious.

it was a half-lie, i do have to work on some assignments, but i wasn’t going to do them right away, i was planning to just relax. i moved around him (tight space, so super uncomfortable) and got to the elevator. at that point, he gave up, but here’s where your vote comes in, reddit.

i think i was justified, being that i’m not a free babysitter and i think the dude has to be at least a little nuts to leave his kid in the hands of a complete stranger for an unspecified amount of time. my friend, on the other hand, thinks i wasn’t because i lied about having to work right away, and that the guy could have been having an emergency and it would have been nice to help him out for a bit.

Here is all the **relevant information**:

* We live in a city with a population of about 42,000. In 2013, the burglary rate was 0.85%. 
* [Here](http://i.imgur.com/MuoD9Mp.png) is the historical burglary rates compared to the US Average for our city.
* We live on the **3rd** floor of an apartment building that has three apartments per floor. (Passers by are much less likely to climb several flights of stairs to burglarize us.)
* We know all of the neighbors on our floor.
* Our apartment has a gate that has a lock on it, but the lock on the gate is currently disabled so the mailman can deliver mail. (But to a passerby, they can't really tell if it is locked or unlocked.
* We have a security camera that faces the front door from inside the apartment that records upon motion detection and stores the video offsite. (To the apartment next door.)
* We have an alarm system that detects when the door is opened and sounds an alarm and notifies the apartment occupants' mobile devices when the door has been opened. The alarm has to be armed for it to do this.
* My roommate has a computer setup which I'll generously estimate the value at $2000 and a bike which I'll also generously value at $500.
* I've offered to reimburse him for the value of anything that would get stolen if we were to get robbed. (I'm confident this would never happen.)

**My philosophy on locking the door**

Appropriate times to lock the door:

* No one is in the apartment *and* we are not next door in the neighbors apartment. (Note: our neighbors apartment door is literally 1 step from our front door.)
* Everyone in the apartment is sleeping.

**My roommates philosophy on locking the door**

Appropriate times to lock the door:

* If you're going to leave the apartment for more than two minutes, even just to go next door to our neighbor's apartment, lock the door.

* Everyone in the apartment is sleeping.

I do not want to have to lock the door every time I need to go borrow a cup of sugar from our neighbors. It is excessive and annoying.

My roommate says this about why he wants to lock the door so much:
>The time and effort it takes me to lock the door is much less costly in terms of time and money if we were to get robbed.

>The security system doesn't matter, because someone could still walk in and damage something.

**People shouldn't let fear dictate their habits to this degree.**

d7b7yb,1569076348,AITA for telling my partner to not come home after a night out,"Tonight was long, exhausting and quite possibly could have gone better. 

Before tonight my partner had spent the last few days in hospital with our 4 month old son. She wanted to spend the night out together and have a few drinks without our oldest child (4, austitic). 

We went out for dinner at around 6pm with our 4 month old, 2 year old and one of her friends. Dinner was great kids were happy and partner plus friend said they were going to have a smoke. During this time I took the 2 year old into the playground and had the youngest with me in the pram. 

~20 minutes later at 8pm my partner returned gathering her credit card and exclaiming that shes going to the poker machines with her friend and will be back soon... this is where things went downhill. 

Whilst they went off to have some time together I stayed with the kids at the playground waiting for there return so we could go home. We had arrived in one car and I had the least amount to drink so I thought best to wait it out while she had some de-stress time.

Time went on and on and at some point my phone battery died. Tantrum and bottles later I had two very tired kids ready to go to sleep yet still no sign of mum and friend. I spent some time walking around looking for a clock as children are not allowed on premises after 10pm yet could not find any in sight. 

10pm rolled around as i was asked to leave with the children. Heading to the car I still had yet to hear or see any sign of them, baby had woken for bottle and toddler ready to tear the roof down. After feeding the baby and putting both kids to sleep I started doing laps of the small car park in hopes they would show up.. for 40 minutes. 

At 10:40 I bit the bullet and left to source a phone charger to atleast try make contact. Upon turning on the phone, no missed calls or messages. I called my partner, fuming at this point and told her we were asked to leave to which her response to her friend was ""what should we do, I want to stay out for the night"" 

This just added fuel to the fire as I was extremely frustrated from making the children wait so long and late with no effort to communicate these intentions to us. 

I left and told her no to bother coming home tonight as she won't be welcome. She has since caught a taxi to her friends house where they will be staying the night.

He started going into a tangent about how he is overworked, and how I can't expect him to work over the weekend. I understood, and apologised. I also said however that it was a non issue, I am perfectly fine with him replying on Monday, and that he should move past it. He bought it up whilst we were discussing another issue. And it felt like deterrence. Was this rude of me? 

Also, the same teacher, in my written reports, has raised numerous issues that I was previously completely unaware of. I.e, he was saying I wasn't focusing in class, despite making no attempt to alert me to the fact that he thought this was an issue. I do not believe this is fair. Every other teacher I've had has told me that if they have an issue with me, they will explain it to me before they write it in my reports (THIS IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE and imo boils down to basic respect). No one likes seeing new issues raised in there written reports. I don't think reports should be news. My other teacher said, and I quote: ""If you're surprised with what I write in your report, I am not doing my job correctly"".

I want all of us to have a better relationship but we obviously all need work. My immediate family is my aunt, grandparents, mom, and two sisters. My aunt and grandparents live next door so we’re always in contact. 

It’s not like I want to just leave and never come back. I just want to live on my own (with my boyfriend, 18M) and handle my business. I’ve been planning this for about a year now and I’m finally in the position to make it happen, with my boyfriends help ofc. We’ve been together and planning since I was 15 and he was 16. 

He’s been nothing but kind and respectful to my family no matter what they say about him or how they treat him. But still, they talk shit about whoever they can. They’re very negative people unless somehow everyone’s in a good mood. Most days can be full of built up stress and most days can be peaceful. But I’m tired of being anxious of getting in trouble or yelled at for the littlest things. I’m hate the negativity that comes with living with them. 

We’re planning to move in a month. We’re about to get a car. I plan on visiting often but ik living here full time is just not good for me anymore. 

My family is pretty much against the idea of me moving two hours away with my boyfriend. They think I’m being irresponsible and that I’ll end up homeless and a druggie (their words, mainly based on stereotypes of my boyfriend.) I’ve let it slip a few times that I plan on moving out and there’s always been mixed responses. They’ll say rude things that make me so upset that it stays on my mind for days. Or if we’re arguing they’ll say no one even wants me here anyways. Don’t get me wrong though, I partake in this type of stuff too. I really don’t want to but when somebody is beating me down, it’s hard for me to not say something back. Especially to family.  But I don’t mind being here when everyone is calmed tf down and not fucking yelling. 

Heres the thing. To avoid any arguments and rude comments about my plans, I’ve been telling everybody (including nosey family who doesn’t live here) that I’m moving to go to a college program for honors students to take classes early and get credits. I am an all A’s student and I’m in online school so it adds up. Nobody thinks I’m lying. Sigh. Btw, the town is a college-town so the rent is cheap and it’s a very nice area. I plan on actually going to that college once I graduate. 

My parents know that the real reason I want to leave is because I don’t want to live here anymore. They know I’m lying about the program but they’d rather not hear all the bullshit from my grandparents so they aren’t saying anything to anyone about me lying.

I started at a private Catholic boys high school this year and right off the bat I met this kid. He seemed pretty cool at first and we started to get closer. He was very clearly gay from when you talked to him( not being homophobic, that’s just the vibe he gave off). So naturally being around a bunch of rich douches, some started making homophobic jokes about him. He took this very hard and was a mess for days and his grades dropped.

I especially appreciate those that explained what I could do better in the situation. I wasn't ""trying to be cool"" or anything like that. She's my sister, that's just a fact to me. I was trying to provide context for what I thought was a funny coincidence, but I did it in the wrong way. I'll do my best to improve in the future.

(Also, for those that asked, I was not sober during this experience. That may have played a part in my idiocy.)


For context, I am a white guy. My family is all white except for my youngest sister, who is adopted and African American. 

Last weekend, I was at my regular bar talking to an African American guy (John). John is another regular that I'd seen around but hadn't talked to until recently. He saw someone else he knew so he started talking to then and I was just waiting at the bar watching some college football.

I was also dancing around a bit while I waited. This is a dive bar, so I'm not doing much, just grooving a little. I'm not a great dancer, I would say actually say I'm pretty bad, but it's fun, ya know?

He comes back and laughs at me a little and says ""man, you dance like such a white guy."" I laugh and say ""yeah, that's kind of funny you say that, my sister is adopted..."" at that point he kind of cuts me off. He says that's not ok to just randomly say, that it shouldn't matter. He was pretty upset about it. 

Eventually I was able to explain that I was going to tell him that my sister tells me that I ""dance like a white guy"" all the time as well. I thought it was a funny thing, but he was pretty cold the rest of the night.

I thought it was a funny coincidence, but a couple people I've talked to said it was inappropriate for me to bring up my sister like that in that context. Was I an asshole for this?",1572681648.0,asshole,28,45,1
art9go,1550464339,AITA for not being excited about someone else's good news?,"So this is kind of different from what I see on here and it mostly pertains to people who are Greek (Fraternities and sororities). However, the main idea is easy to understand so anyone is welcome to answer. But real quick...

Pdad - Sorority girls tend to ask Frat guys if they would want to be their Pdad. Its usually asked of someone you have a platonic relationship with and have come to be very close to as a friend and mentor. (can also have Pmoms).

Big Bro - A brother from your Fraternity that is meant to guide you in life, academics and the ways the Frat is run. 

Psibling - Someone who shares the same PDad/Mom as you or someone who has asked your Big Bro or Big sis to be their PDad/Mom. 

(These terms can be different depending on the organization but this is how it works in mine.)

So recently my fraternity went to hang out with a sorority. I recently joined so I didn't know the sorority girls at all so it was mostly me getting to know people. After an hour or so I was sitting on the couch talking when one girl came over and she asked ""How would you feel about having a Psibling?"". I wasn't sure what to say and I didn't know what that was so I replied ""What is a Psibling?"". She explained that she would be asking my Big Bro to be her Pdad so we would become my Psiblings. I personally didn't care, I already knew they were close and that the relationship they had was platonic. So I wasn't sure what she wanted me to say, ""Do you want my blessing or something? I mean congrats but I'm not sure what to say."" I don't know if I came off sounding like a jerk but I honestly don't care. She's going to ask him regardless and what he does is his business. On top of that, I just met her that day so I'm not really sure what to do besides saying congrats and moving on. 

Now I'm thinking I might have come off a bit mean since afterwards she was giving me attitude for the rest of the night and just blatantly ignored me at a party while talking to my brothers.  If it were just a random sorority girl, I wouldn't really care, but since my Big Bro is probably saying yes, I'll probably see her a lot more at parties and events. I don't really  care if we're friends, but I wouldn't mind if we're at least on speaking terms so we avoid any awkward moments and for my Big Bro's sake.

He’s from a different department but on the same floor, and all the departments here work closely with each other here. Company HR here is also the vibrant, young type, so all new joiners are introduced to the entire company of around 100 staff. 

A month after Dave arrives, Dave and I are put in a work discussion together. A few days after the discussion, he messages me on the company chat platform. 

Dave: waving emoji.

Me: hii

Dave: I’m Dave, officially \*another waving emoji\*

Me: Hi Dave! \*waving emoji\*

Dave: How’s it going? Are you working on a lot of stuff?

I am slightly weirded out by this personal turn, so I don’t reply. A week later, he messages me again:

Dave: Any weekend plans?

Me: workworkwork

Dave: Lol. That busy huh?

Again I ignore him because work is work, and I have absolutely no interest in making another friend here. I’m an introvert, and I admit I’m not the friendliest person because I take some time to warm up to new people. The next layer is I don’t like making friends with guys due to my experiences with ‘platonic’ male friends in the past.  

We’re put onto another project, and whenever I see his name pop up in the chat, I dread his messages. The next time he messages me, it’s about work. I gladly answer him. His follow up message: Are you going for the company movie night tonight?

Me: yup

Dave: cools

It’s been two months since this message, and thankfully he hasn’t messaged me anymore. But it hasn’t really ended, just died down because we were at a company retreat some time back and when he comes up to me in person, I am professional and talk to him – it’s not like I run and hide. A few days after the company retreat, he adds me on Facebook. 

I ignore the request, like everything else. 

These days, I try not to be in the pantry if he’s there, because I don’t want to experience any of the awkwardness because he’s obviously all right with double messages and ignored friend requests.

I’ve brought this up with my close colleagues at work (all women), and none of them have encountered this problem with him. I have no idea why he’s so friendly to ONLY ME when he has a girlfriend that he constantly posts about on his Instagram. I did some sleuthing, and found his profile. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t know I have a boyfriend, and I don’t want to think of his actions as being interested in me.

These days I try to avoid him in the pantry or communal areas, and luckily we haven’t been assigned to any projects together.

• No shorts
• No friends over

My daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.

The issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn’t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. 

My mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can’t take care of it. 

My mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me “I’m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I’m a piece of shit.” I’m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.

And the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves.

I find it strange she even thinks it’s okay to “judge” others so harshly.

For context: My best friend and I have been on-and-off-besties for the past 17 years. I am 19 now. So we basically grew up together. Depending on in which state of our development we were in, we either loved or hated each other. We also could be best friends on one day and hate each other the next. I guess it is because we two are very different. 

I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 17. It’s just...my best friend has always had troubles understanding that. She seems to think that every obstacle in life can be overcome just by trying hard enough. Whenever I would cry and tell her how much I can’t stand living at home anymore and how much I just wish for this pain to end, she showed no sympathy. But eventually I arranged myself with that and we kept our relationship more superficial and I was fine with that.

It’s just lately that my mental health has really been getting worse and worse. I am one the verge of finally moving out but it causes me a lot of anxiety. On the same page I had a horrible break with some of my closest friends that really kicked in a lot of self doubt and self hatred again. I’ve slowly tried to regain my confidence and don’t fall back into old toxic patterns. But well...things have been rough.

Now today she sent me a message saying she finds me to be very needy and selfish right now. Basically saying I never ask how she is doing and only come to her when my world is in pieces. Now I am not going to lie. I know I am hard to be around right now, I do need more “attention” than usually and I am very cynical right now. But I am really trying to be better. 

The point where she crossed a line for me however was as she basically told me: “I think the reason why you can’t seem to find a partner right now or why you don’t have so many friends is really because you just care about yourself. If you would try to be better other’s would like you more.” My first reaction was: who the fuck does she think she is? well thanks for telling me I suck.

Anyways. We put together a guest list. We both agreed and came up with 50 people we wanted to include. Unfortunately, this did mean excluding some extended family on both sides. We agreed it was necessary, for both social and financial reasons. He mentioned this to his mom (no specific names given) and she got a little weird about it. Long story short, she goes on vacation with extended family and starts telling people that we aren’t inviting them. Everyone is angry with us and it’s gearing up to create a huge amount of drama around what should’ve been a celebratory day. It’s really upset my fiancé and I. I know it’ll upset her and she’ll probably pester my fiancé about it, but WIBTA if I decided to keep any future plans to myself? I’m tired of getting steamrolled/guilted about the wedding.

Recently I 28f sent what I thought was an innocent text to my boyfriend 29m asking him as a favor to tell me he finds me attractive/pretty (not exact words, much less desperate). he knows I struggle with a little bit of low self esteem at times and Can be a little hard on myself about my appearance. Lately I’ve been battling more acne and eczema on my face than usual due to having to take extra birth control for an ovarian cyst on top of bloating and other things. I’ve been in pain and so I haven’t been moving around a lot either. He responded saying if that’s what I wanted maybe he wasn’t the guy for me and that he can’t fix 28 years of low self esteem overnight and reminding me of the time I asked him if he thought I was pretty when we had first started dating. I think he took it as a personal attack. 
When he got home we barely said anything to each other and the next day I tried to express my feelings in as gentle a way as I could. I told him it’s nothing he did but that this new med has me feeling a little down and I could use his help and that it hurt my feelings the way he responded the day before. I also said if asking for help gets this type of response then how do we move forward? 
His only response to That  was that he felt he had to be blunt with me but no explanation why. 
He almost never says anything positive about my appearance, nothing negative either but I’m always telling him he looks good or he’s handsome etc. and I watch his face light up every time.  I honestly didn’t think it was anything crazy to ask. We didn’t speak at all for a while and it really upset me. Granted I am more emotional than usual unfortunately. I decided to let him have some space and go to my moms for the night, I haven’t heard anything from him. I sent a text reminding him of some stuff we had in the fridge for dinner and letting him know I really care about him and that I hope he can see my side.

I was planning to spend most of the trip with my friend and he was planning to spend most of the trip with his friends, which was fine with both of us. 

However, his friends are very insistent that I spend my weekend with them. I wanted to spend my weekend with my friend, who I don't get to see very often, and I know she's more into hanging with just me, potentially my boyfriend too, not his friends. My boyfriend understands that, yet he keeps telling me that his friends keep getting annoyed that I'm not as readily available as they expected, which in turn is leading to him getting extremely upset with his friends.

But, earlier, one of his friends messaged me to tell me that they were planning a birthday surprise for him, and they really wanted me to be there. I mentioned to my boyfriend that this friend of his contacted me to coordinate my own plans (yet mentioned nothing about the surprise), and he got extremely upset, saying that it feels like his friends are undermining him and going over his head.

Usually it’s whatever and I give it to most people who ask me but the thing is Gaby never pays attention in class. She is either whispering to someone or playing poptropica on her computer while the teacher is lecturing. In fact most days my class goes over the homework before we turn it in.

Today Gaby asks for my math homework the period before. I don’t really care about that it’s not great but I can understand, but more often it’s about my science homework.

She's an awesome person and fellow  LGBT+ and is one of the few people I would trust with my life (in fact,  she has my power of medical attorney and I'm hers so, in a sense, that  is a very literal statement).

When she got the news we spent most of the  night concluding that the best solution  might be for her and I to split a place given my decent  income and housing aid from my University.

But the next day someone who I used to be good friends  with but am now on mixed terms with suggested that they get a place and she had tentatively accepted. This guy has no income and has shown no drive to  improve his situation.  I have tried to help him for over a year by sending him jobs and arranging interviews,  trying to get him back into school, and helping cover his expenses... With no results.

He  is currently living on someone's couch and working a minimum  wage job one day a week plus handouts. And  when he has money he generally spends it on weed, smoking three or more times a day, or on things  like a tattoo that he paid several hundred dollars for instead of paying off dept or for his driver's license to be reinstated  (he is now being sued for that dept and thinks that he does nothing then it will be fine). He  also sleeps constantly including through job interviews...

He  claims that a higher paying job is right around the corner but he's also said that in the past... Right  before he decided that he couldn't handle working more than a day and give up his apartment  in town in favor of a friend's couch (kinda screwing his former roommate). 

He also regularly ignores requests to avoid topics, basically I had a traumatic experience that left me with mental scars and while I am actively in treatment some topics still trigger a panic/anxiety, and at this  point I just don't want to be around him. So having my friend live with  him would mean that I could not visit her.

My friend has issues with depression and keeping a steady work  schedule but has been on a good trajectory recently and I would hate for her to derail that. I'm worried that living with this guy would do that since even if he could pay the rent he doesn't encourage good behavior.

Am I the asshole for trying to dissuade her from  this course of action and am I being selfish? I just want her to  have a stable place to live that will help her. She wants to give him a chance since she knows he wouldn't be able to get a place on his own... But neither could I.

She's my best friend and I would do  anything for her, she saved my life after I fell into depression after my girlfriend and I separated, and I hate to see her throw away a secure future for one  with someone just because she feels like he needs a chance (she's much  more of a bleeding heart than I am).",False,no assholes here,5,10,0

A couple weeks ago I was at my friend A’s house for a party with our friend group and SOs. A’s brother M lives at the house with her as a favor to their parents. 

During the M starts chilling with me and it’s fine for a bit but then he starts being really touchy. I quietly told him I was uncomfortable with how much he was touching me since I don’t know him that well and I have a boyfriend. He said it was NBD and went off to talk to some other people there. 

Apparently After he left M started talking to a couple of other people and found out that my boyfriend is Jewish. I know this because he came over to where I was and started saying a lot of shit about my boyfriend that really upset me. He kept going off saying that my boyfriend must be a “cheap ass jew” since my clothes weren’t “all that nice”, and don’t I know that my boyfriend is going to force me to have his kids and give up my career since he’s jewish. 

I told M to cut the shit and tried to move away from him multiple times but he kept following me around the house and saying a lot of really nasty things about my boyfriend for being Jewish as well as nasty things about me since I’m dating someone who is Jewish. 

I ended up losing my cool and I told him off for the things he was saying and for following me around the house when I had told him he was making me uncomfortable. I wasn’t quiet about it and I probably could have handled it better but I was really upset at that point. 

A heard what happened and was furious with her brother and asked him to leave for the night or go stay in his room.

Now the problem is, a couple of the people at the party including some of my friends, say I’m TA for telling him off so publicly. They said I shouldn’t have said anything since it wasn’t my house and that I ruined the atmosphere of the party for them. They said if I had to call him out I should have just taken him aside and left it at that.

bms5v7,1557451648,AITA for “punishing” my 14 yr old daughter when she hasn’t done anything wrong?,"I’m not even sure how to make this make sense but here goes. My husband and I have 3 daughters, the youngest of which is 14.  We are/ have always been a pretty close, laid back family.  We aren’t religious but have always encouraged the girls to form their own beliefs.   My youngest daughter, Rose, has always been a little different than the rest of us personality wise. She’s extroverted, we’re introverted. She’s in the popular group, not as academic, but very talented musically. I’ve always encouraged her pursuits and supported her and she is very loved but I can tell sometimes that she feels different.  

So these past few months she’s been spending more and more time at her friend Autumn’s house. Basically nowadays she wants to go over there on Friday afternoons and stay until Sunday. She’s been going with them to church. I don’t LOVE that but have been cool about it because I want her to feel free to explore her own beliefs.  And I also don’t love that she’s been spending so much time away from home. I’ve allowed it out of a sense of guilt because her father and I both have to work most weekends. And I work overnights so we can’t really do many fun family activities on the weekend.   My problem is that lately I’ve been getting a bad vibe from the whole situation. I’ve seen texts on her phone with Autumn’s mom. She is constantly telling her how much she loves her and is now a total part of their family. She seems to feel some sort of ownership over Rose’s weekends and even tried to get her to spend all of Easter weekend with them. I put my foot down about that because we had plans already and I just feel like holidays are a time for family. Now Rose is invited to their house for Mother’s Day weekend which is also going to be a no because I’m off work and it’s MOTHERS day. They want her to go on vacation with them this summer for a month. That’s gonna be another no. I just feel like it’s inappropriate. But Rose loves it over there and doesn’t ever want to be home anymore.   Basically I just have this crazy feeling that this mother is trying to adopt my daughter out from under me. They’re evangelical Christians and I feel like maybe they’re trying to “save” her from us? I don’t know if I’m crazy or paranoid. I want to put a stop to this. I want to stop letting her go over there at all. I’ve let it go on this long because I feel so guilty that I can’t give her whatever it is that they can. I have to work long hours, I don’t have a choice, and she’s a stay at home mom. They’re pretty well off and we’re middle class through and through.  But Rose hasn’t done anything wrong and she’s going to see this as a punishment. I already feel like I’m losing her and I’m worried that if I make her cut off contact I will push her even further away. I guess I’m a shit mother through and through either way but AITA if I go with my gut and stop her relationship with this other family?





The game plan going forward is #1 I’m going try to take every other weekend off from work and establish more family time #2 not cutting her off completely from her friend but establishing more incentive to be invested with her own family (ie activities, one on one time, etc) #3 really just taking the time to listen to her and what she’s trying to tell me and #4 an honest conversation with the other mom and we’ll just have to see how that goes before I can judge how much time she should be spending over there.  

I really just want her to know how loved she is and not feel like she has to go elsewhere to be accepted. I don’t know if I can undo all of this damage but I’m going to give it my all. Thanks again.",1557494394.0,not the asshole,2959,712,0

I was playing a game and she came into my room and started talking to me for about 20 minutes. At some point, she started talking about a half-sister from my dad's side I don't know who makes illustrations and children's books. (I'm pretty sure that her resentment for my dad also applies to his family.)

She went on to call one of her books shit. That's the word she used. She complained about every aspect of it, complained about how she spent 3 months making something she thought was lazily-made and then asked for my opinion (she says a lot of stuff I don't agree with and when I tell her what I think, she yells at me, so I tend to keep to myself. It annoys her.).

I told her how that was her opinion and she shouldn't say it's shit, and she started getting angry and complaining about how I never agree with her. She then showed me the book, which I found to be fine (I'd link it, but since her name's on there, it might reveal mine). After that, I got carried away, and said I found the way she acted sickening. She then brought up some families issues which I told her didn't matter to me anymore and weren't related, said she'd remember what I said and left. She's still mad at me, but she still brought me bread and ham earlier so I could eat something for dinner.

She's had troubles. She's still not over many issues with our family, in particular my sister who made a ruckus when she left the house. Since she'd been telling me about them for years, I thought she was right on most things, but now, I'm starting to understand the reasons why my sister was unhappy with how things were going and I can relate more and more to it, so I don't know what to think anymore... I know she wants what's right for me and still loves me, but at the same time, she's arrogant, often impolite, and critical of most things. She spends most of her time with me criticizing our country's government, and when I call her out on it, she says it's part of my education and she has the right to talk about whatever she wants in her home. But we're the only ones living in the apartment. I feel like she's trying to force her opinions on me. I'm also starting to think she makes all of our issues about her.

But at the same time.... I don't think I've been nice to her. I rarely care about what she has to say, so I end up not listening. As a result, I forget the important stuff and bad things happen. I never give her any gifts because I don't know how to do so properly, or what to give her, even though I have no issues gifting stuff to my best friend. Is it because I actually know what to give him ? Is it because I just don't want to even though I should?

She talks a lot and repeats things, and I always complain when she does, because I understood what she asked, even though that's not even always the case. I avoid topics that matter to the both of us because we've already established things, or because it would only hurt us, but I'm starting to question myself on that as well. She loves me and we mess around like family should, but why does I feel so bad about being around her now ?

This... kinda escalated from what I expected to write. I just wanted to give some context to how things went at first, but it went further... way further. I guess I needed to tell someone. Please tell me if this is against the rules.

She confronted me today asking why it is that I haven’t posted a picture with us and I told her that I hadn’t really gotten around to it since it doesn’t seem like a big deal to me. I also told her that I’ve never really been the type to post about my relationships all that much because I feel like my feed is about my life and any big events that occur, plus I have always believed that posting pictures dedicated to your SO come off as ingenious and in the event you break up they would have to be deleted anyways.

She then got upset and said that I’m very inconsiderate and that she doesn’t even want to take pictures with me anymore because “what’s the point.“ she also took down the post of me and her since she said “it doesn’t matter anyways right?” I personally think she is being really childish about the whole situation and I don’t get why it’s such a big deal. Can someone please tell me AITA. 

P.S please no r/niceguys in the comments

Edit: thank you all for your input, after having thought about it and having read your comments I realized how when I told her how I felt about my page I really screwed the pooch. Upon realizing this I apologized to her profusely and she apologized for making me feel as if me not posting a picture diminished from all the other things I’ve done for her to show my affection. As of now we are on good terms once again and we’re gonna watch some game of thrones to conclude the make up. ",1554248461.0,everyone sucks,18,32,1
co26ko,1565356322,AITA for letting girls wear my hoodie that aren’t my gf?,"Basically, my girlfriend is a bit annoyed because I said I would let other girls wear my hoodies if they were cold.

b6jt8x,1553785132,AITA for telling my ex that I won't get back with with them unless they cut ties with mutual friend,"My ex broke up with me about 2 weeks ago, out of the blue. We basically stopped talking completely during those 2 weeks, and I took comfort in one of our mutual friends (we'll call her SF), who was there for me the whole time. 

This past weekend the ex and I decided to talk about everything and he admitted to kissing SF a couple days after we broke up. They were both going through some rough emotional times, and he said they both took comfort in knowing that the other cared about them. He's the one who initiated the kiss, but SF didn't have to kiss him back (she had a bf at the time). They have both apologized to me and said it was a mistake and shouldn't have happened, but I feel betrayed, especially since SF never mentioned the kiss to me, I had to find out through my ex. SF acted like my friend the whole time, without me knowing that she kissed him.

Ex said he's been enjoys spending time with me since we've been seeing each other more after the break, likes being around me and is considering getting back together with me but I told him I wouldn't take him back unless he cut SF out of his life. 

I feel really conflicted asking this of him, because I feel like it's too controlling, but he's the one who broke my trust and kissed our friend. He said he doesn't have any feelings for her, but I think SF might have feelings for him. I get friends can care deeply about each other, but not to the point of kissing right after he broke up with me.

Am I the asshole for making him do this?

Edit: I've already talked to him about it, and he was willing to stop talking to her because he still loves and cares about me. I just feel like a jerk for making him make that choice, like it's her or me.

aw08fs,1551412516,WIBTA for confronting my S.O.'s friends for messing with our open relationship?,"I don't believe in exclusive relationships. I don't think love should restrict people in any way, and I think people should be free to express love to anyone and not reserve it for one person. I've been in a wonderful open relationship for quite some time now. (Let's call her Ava) Neither of us have ever even pursued other people outside our relationship, and neither of us plan to, but we like the idea of having the freedom to do so if we chose.

Admittedly, I don't think Ava shared my belief originally, but after I told her what I felt she came around to agreeing with me. Ever since, we've been in a great relationship with practically no problems. Once she told me she was anxious that a female friend I was hanging out with would ""steal"" me, so I cut ties with the friend pretty quick because I don't want to worry her.

Ava has two friends she sees every day. We're cool with each other. We often hang out just the four of us, but I'm newest to the group. Every day when I'm not there, those two friends roast Ava for being in a relationship with me. They tell her that I'm using her, I don't really love her, etc. They literally call me a crackhead when I'm not around. It got to the point where Ava said that I'm almost all they talk about anymore. I was cool with it because I knew Ava knew those things weren't true. We figure they're either uncomfortable with our open relationship or jealous, because they've been single their whole lives. The thing is though, they're both cool people. I get that they're doing this because they think they're protecting her.

A couple hours ago, I went to see Ava and she was visibly troubled and sad. She told me that they really roasted her more than normal today, and one of them said ""This isn't really a roast, you just think it is because you know we're right."" Apparently that got to her, and she told me that she's anxious about our relationship now. The whole night we kept saying that we were content with our situation, we loved each other, and we didn't want to end things, but she was still troubled after what her friends said. Against my beliefs, I agreed to be in an exclusive relationship with her because I knew it'd make her feel better.

Later I realized that the whole thing was spurred by these two friends. Basically, I had to surrender a belief I held highly because they got in her head. I wanted to go to their houses and ask them to stop harassing Ava about us, direct and honest, but I figured I'd wait a day to clear my head. I don't want to tell Ava about it because I know she'll tell me not to, then I'd have to go against her wishes. Tomorrow I'm probably going to talk to them, WIBTA?

TL;DR: My significant other's friends harass her about our happy open relationship. This made her anxious, so I had to change to an exclusive relationship, which I don't believe in. I want to confront them and tell them to stay in their lane.

EDIT: I should clarify that we came up with the idea for an open relationship before we began dating. I think I made it sound like I persuaded her from an exclusive relationship to that. We were both anxious about a relationship so I introduced her to an open relationship and we both liked the idea.",1551415655.0,asshole,9,20,1

Guy: ""All you have to do is change out the weights man""
Guy continues to argue that I should work in with my friend

Now, I would agree with this guy, however my friend is a serious lifter and can squat more than 100 pounds than I can. Additionally, me and friend are at different heights so we would have to constantly change the height of the bar as well. This guys tone was also kind of entitled, as if  we were supposed to work in with each other from the beginning. ( I know, a little biased).

bd3jq4,1555253776,AITA for thinking my fiancé’s parents should contribute more money to our wedding if they want to invite more people?,"Let me start off by giving some context to the situation. My fiancé and his family are Indian, and I and my family are white American. We got engaged last October, and ultimately both of our groups of parents very generously offered a large amount of money for the wedding. We plan on having an Indian wedding, as well as a civil ceremony, which means it is a multi-day affair, effectively making the total cost skyrocket. Extra days of events means extra food, extra decor, extra space rentals, extra photographers, etc. etc. 

My parents were very no-strings-attached and said they just want us to be happy (that we could take the money and put a down payment on a house or go on vacation for all they care). My parents are divorced, and both provided a huge amount of money within their means and easily covers my family and our friends. 

However, my fiancé’s parents have not been as lax. They said that they would match however much my parents decided to give and would not go higher. Okay, fine. Still a very generous amount of money, and would cover a healthy amount of guests. 

We sat down and discussed who they would like invited, and their number of people is effectively double the number of my family and our (mine and fiancé’s) mutual friends combined. They insist that they do not need to provide any more money, and that as long as we “plan smart, don’t use as many flowers, and don’t use fancy decorations” that we should be able to accommodate everyone. It is simply not true. Without going too much into financials, it would cost an extra $10,000 to accommodate the extra people his parents want to invite for the reception alone. Forget the extra ceremonies. They’ve gone so far as to say we should just cut the other ceremonies, which would take away from the whole point of having an Indian wedding. 

In addition, we are receiving extra pressure from them because they recently attended a large Indian wedding that they EXTREMELY disliked, because the couple was over budget and had to cut corners, resulting in poor planning, not as “fancy” decorations, and not great food (all things they insisted we need to avoid). 

My fiancé and I are at an impasse with his parents. They are demanding that we invite all of their guests, but aren’t willing to pay any extra cash for them. When we explain that we have to cut the guest list to reasonably stay in budget, they say “it’s not the Indian way” or “we’ll be exiled from the Indian community” or “well, the bride’s family is supposed to pay for everything anyway, so we’ve already been plenty generous”. 

We’ve barely spoken with his parents in weeks. We are a year out from our planned wedding date, and we can’t even book a venue because his parents won’t settle on financials and guest list.

When I see him, I want to spend all my time with him. I'm not a talkative or energetic person, and even though I love going out when we can I equally enjoy spending time together, sitting together, watching stuff and all of that. But he likes to play games with his friends online for a few hours which means he is sitting across the room from me talking to his friends. I'd prefer to spend as much time together possible, I'm not sure if this is unreasonable.

I wouldn't care at all if I was living with him, but the problem is that I almost never see him (most important), and the cost of the ticket, and the 10-16 hour flight, him playing with his friends when I am a guest there and don't have anyone there.

You’ve probably seen it yourself on your own Facebook feed. The seller does not disclose much info (not even the brand for crying out loud), making YOU dependent on THEM to get your supply. But even worse is that it’s made of silica and crap which scratches away at enamel and potentially ruins teeth. It is literally frowned upon by dentists and hygienists. If you ask me it’s a huge scam, as most MLM products are. And then, hilariously, the seller’s friends (who also sell this product!) comment things like, “I always stock up! Love this stuff.” B-A- fucking- R-F. 

Anyway, I’m soooo tempted to innocently comment on her post asking if she knows this is a scam (or something to that effect). You know, like, “did you know this stuff is actually very abrasive on your teeth enamel? Dentists frown upon it. Just thought you should know!! :)”  would that be awful of me?

bghv9e,1556034128,AITA for not wanting a relationship with my dad's family?,"This is something that I've struggled with for a while, and I'm not going to lie, I'm a little worried at the responses I'm going to get.

&#x200B;

So, I have no connection to my dad's side of the family. He's BARELY been around my entire life. He's always lived in another state; he took off before I was born because my mom, who was 19 at the time, didn't want to leave all of her family and friends and the life she knew to move to Ohio with him. I adored him when I was a kid, even though I only saw him maybe once a year, and anytime I did see him, he was too busy working to also spend any time with me. But the older I got, the more I got recognized and got sick of his false promises, lying, and manipulation to try to keep me around.

&#x200B;

Now here's where his family gets involved. Well for one, every time I get sick of my dad's shit, they come to his defense and tell me ""I only have one dad. I should give him a break."" No. I don't see it like that. I'm ok with only having the people who I genuinely love and who genuinely love me in my life. I'm not a blood is thicker than water person. Life's too short for that mess. So, as the constant lies and manipulation and disappointment severed my emotional ties with him over the years, so went any link to that side of the family.

So where things get a little hairy are my grandparents on that side. I adore my grandpa. He's probably the one person on that side that I love. My grandma, however, is a different story. First, they are HARDCORE Pentecostal. I'm Agnostic and have been for years, although I just really was able to put a name on it about three years ago. My grandmother doesn't know, and I know she wouldn't have that mess. I can't ever talk to her without her giving me a sermon, asking when I went to church last, and asking me to recall the last sermon I heard. She puts down my fiance because he's not a church-going man, which is kind of hilarious considering he does believe in God. She's where my dad gets his manipulative tendencies from because she is always acting like she's mysteriously dying so that I'll feel bad. She's put down my mom, saying that she is to blame for my lack of relationship with my dad. She said that my nana, who is my best friend in the whole world, was a witch to them and my dad when I was little (which I'll give her...my nana is pretty fiercely protective of me and didn't like my dad for my mom's young pregnancy), but here's what I CANNOT abide. My papa, the nicest, sweetest man on this earth, a man who knows no stranger and will give anyone the shirt off his back, was the subject of her wrath one day. She said when I was young my papa was at a yard sale and was carrying me, and my grandpa was nearby, and she said I was reaching out to him. My papa saw, but turned and walked away with me. He would never do that. So that pissed me off.

I noticed she had headphones in, so I figured I'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as I'm sitting down.

As soon as I touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck I was doing. I explained. She then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. I told her I knew for a fact she was alone because I just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond.

I really look forward to these days and plan out the meals carefully. My last cheat day was on Saturday and I planned to cook chicken breast wrapped in bacon in cheese sauce for dinner (my dad used to cook it and it was my favorite dish as a kid). I bought the ingredients a couple days before and invited my girlfriend over for that night. When I went to cook it I realised that there was only 1 chicken breast left, which is only enough for 1 person, my roommate had eaten the other (he's not the asshole, we eat eachothers food sometimes and I forgot to tell him not to eat any of the food I planned to cook with). I was really looking forward to this meal so I wanted to cook it anyway and suggested my girlfriend ordered a pizza instead. She knows how much I look forward to these cheat day meals so thought she would understand. She did not. She called me an asshole for not making anything for her so I offered to cook some pasta for her, but said I would still have the chicken. She said it was too late for me to offer that and it still didn't fix the problem and left. If I didn't eat the chicken that night I wouldn't be able to have it for another few weeks so I was dead set on having it, even if she couldn't.

Edit: I couldn't go out and get more chicken since stores close earlier where I live. It's not like the US where places are open 24/7.

cazpmf,1562672219,AITA for my bff ditching me?,"Everyone in my family says that I am NOT the asshole and I should cut this person out.. but I’m not sure. 

I’ll get to the point it is my birthday tonight so my bff and I went out. She is in a new relationship and I’m single. We went out drinking, we specifically went to a gay bar so she could feel comfortable and plus they are super fun everyone is just so sweet and friendly. (We’re both straight girls). A group of guys invited us to their table and we both went along they bought us drinks and everything and we could both tell they were straight...no biggie. I guess she felt really uncomfortable and told me that she needed to go to the bathroom. Mind you I didn’t know that she was lying about going to the bathroom she genuinely said “hey Kate I gotta go to the bathroom” So I said “cool” I was just talking to these guys, they were being really sweet we’re talking about where they’re from and what not and I looked at my clock and realize should be gone for about 20 minutes. She calls me shortly after I look at my phone and realize that she had been gone that long. 

Shes crying when she calls and says she feels really uncomfortable and the guys were hitting on her, she wants to leave because she’s in a relationship. I ran to the bathroom to where she is supposed to be and she’s crying her entire eyes out saying that she feels very uncomfortable and that the guys were totally hitting on her. (Literally they were just being normal, flirty but with EVERYONE.. it’s a club in Hollywood and we were out for my bday) She then said that she is leaving.. I can come with her or i can stay alone with these strangers. She stormed out. I ran after her alone & scared. I kinda forced myself into the car (she kept telling me to fucking get out) bc I would have been alone in Hollywood with no one. 

I was just so confused because we were at least 40 minutes away from our place, she was my ride, it was my birthday and I was just so confused. We got into a massive argument in her car about how she was so ready to ditch me bc we were with straight men at a club when she’s in a relationship. she drove me halfway home while telling me that I needed to get out of her car. At that point I called my mom as we are both balling our eyes out on the side of the rode. My mom drove 45 min at 3am to get me. My bff literally blocked me on all social medical while were were parked claiming that I’m selfish. my mom picked me up halfway and I hopped from her car into my moms car. Literally my mom cried because she couldn’t believe that my best friend gave me such an ultimatum and ditched me on my birthday. 

It’s my bday I’m so confused, I really think that she was so selfish. She didn’t even give me the option to maybe go with her and sit at a different empty table away from the guys (WHO WERE SO NORMAL) she just said you can come with me or I’m leaving you and your drunk self here.",False,not the asshole,40,25,0

bkwwgg,1557057318,"AITA for ""breaking up"" with a friend because he and his fiance refuses to introduce me to a potential partner","First of all this is all happening in a muslim country with moderate tension between religious and secular people.

So, I have coworker named let's say ""John"". He and I've been working together for a year and we've become pretty close friends. So close that I was a kind of pseudo-best man for his engagement, I took care of everything for the engagement party. I was also the only one he invited from the company.

John and his fiance ""Jane"" are very religious, on the contrary I am not. I'm not the neckbeard atheist type but if anyone asks I don't hide my religious beliefs or the lack of them. 

So the engagement party was a small affair, 30 or so people all family and friends. Almost all women were wearing headscarves etc. Not really the type of party you would mingle with the opposite sex. ""Jane"" had invited a few of her friends and they also wore headscarves except one girl. I didn't interact with any of them besides saying hello. 

Anyways, two weeks passed and John out of the blue said ""Hey, do you wanna meet with any of Jane's friends, they are single. But I guess you wouldn't wanna meet any of the girls wearing headscarves?"". I replied with ""I don't care if they are covering their hair or not but I don't think a religous girl would wanna meet me. Did any of the girls mentioned me to Jane?"" to which he replied ""No"". So I said ""Ok then, there was this girl not covering her hair, how about her?"". He was happy to do that and said she was a good person and single.

Two weeks passed so I asked John if Jane had asked the girl about me. He said no, he forgot but he will as soon as possible. Another week passed and I asked him again, this time he said he told Jane but she was dealing with family problems. So I said ""I don't need a formal introduction, just pass her phone number or instagram and I can ask her if she wants to meet."" to which he replied ""Sure, ok"". Another week passes and I again asked John about her and he told me I was too desperate. I reminded him that he was the one to suggest the whole thing, not me but he laughed it off.

Well a week passes again and I was pretty angry about the whole thing. I went to John and told him ""Don't bother, tell Jane not to ask her about me. I changed my mind, I don't even remember what she looks like."" He again laughed it off and said he asked Jane yesterday and I can't change my mind at this point, it would be offensive to the girl. I couldn't contain my anger and told him to fuck himself and that I would not be attending their fucking wedding.

Anyways I decided to cut ties with him because I feel his fiance thinks I'm a bad person since I'm not religious. I don't care about the friend,  I forgot what she looked like. But still him offering to introduce me then refusing to do so feels very immature. Moreover I'm starting realize practicing religious tolerance means nothing unless it's reciprocated. So am I the asshole for cursing him out and ""breaking up"" with him?

Most of us were still really young and didn’t always understand strategy or what we were supposed to do and our dad would get mad if we didn’t play exactly as he expected. We all ended up turning inward ourselves and just doing what we were supposed to do. It was fun but scary because we didn’t know if our decisions were right. 

We stopped playing for years again because life. Now most of my siblings are married and have babies but we decided to get together with my dad and all play again. It was fun, going great, but because of how he acted before some of my siblings were still scared to make decisions in front of him. 

Job changes happened and we could no longer play. A year later my siblings all decided to play again without my dad and wanted to keep it a secret. I live alone with my dad because of financial trouble and told him I was going over to my brothers to visit for a few hours (I’ve been holding this secret for a month feeling like shot the whole time). Then I told him all of us siblings are getting together because of a question he asked and he grew concerned that something was wrong. I told him that we were playing D&D.

So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years now and she has been currently living with my family and I for a few months from personal reasons. 

She has had a pretty rough time warming up to them. She spend most of the time here just locked up in my room and refuses to go out in the kitchen to grab herself something to eat or drink because she is “scared” of encountering my parents. But my parents have done nothing but support her and help her get her life together. She doesn’t pay rent here and my parents have opened the entire fridge and cupboards to her and allow her to eat whatever she wants without pitching in money for groceries. When she was looking to get a new car my family paid for it in full until she could get the money for it and has also added her into our family insurance plan for the time being. My family still plans on having her in the insurance for a discount and just have her pay them each month for it. My girlfriend and I have found an apartment and are moving out in a couple days. She is paying for most of the rent because I am a full time college student and am working part time, I’m giving her 200 a month which she says is totally fine because she was going to move out whether I was coming with her or not. Again, my family helps with this and co-signs the apartment for her before they know I’m moving in (they know now). 

My girlfriend has never grown up around a family like mine. She comes from a single mother household that is borderline abusive. Her mother has done nothing to help her and because of this she hasn’t fully grasped what being in a family is. I understand this yet it’s still frustrating when I hear her saying how she feels like my parents don’t like her or that she doesn’t want to go to thanksgiving with me family simply because she doesn’t like traditional food (it’s her way of saying she doesn’t want to spend time with my family because it’s awkward). I don’t know how my family and I are supposed to support her and involve her more. Family events make her uncomfortable but for my parents it means the world to them.

I want her to be part of my family and be comfortable around them to make them happy, but I also don’t want my girlfriend to just sit there awkwardly the whole time and hate her life. I don’t know what more we can do to get her to warm up. Maybe it’s time? But by the sounds of this it’s going to take a few more years more.

cgdwmx,1563805763,AITA for calling out my parents for not doing enough as a family,"Basically, my family never does anything to the extent that the only reason my parents will leave the house is to go to work or the supermarket. As an older teenager, this has always meant that whenever there is a long stretch of holiday where I don’t have school or college, I won’t leave my house ( even really my room) for the duration of it. My friends are usually on holiday or too busy to meet up and so I don’t really have much option other than to wait out the holiday until term starts.

Because of this after a few weeks of doing nothing I always get quite irritable because I don’t really have the option to leave and go do something as I can’t drive and don’t have a job or access to money (mainly because I have social anxiety but that’s a different story).

I ended up snapping at my mum (who is at home whilst my father is at work) for never wanting to do anything as a family. I told her I don’t understand how she can be happy just watching TV 24/7 and not making memories or spending time with family. We’ve had this argument before and I usually bring up how all my friends go on a yearly holiday which makes her completely disregard my feelings as she starts thinking I’m having a selfish outburst about wanting an expensive holiday.

I try to explain to her that no, I don’t want an expensive holiday, I’m just telling her that other family’s make the effort to go somewhere/do something on a regular basis and that to me, the cost is immaterial, I just want to get out and do something together. Every time she goes off into a rant about how we don’t have enough money/time/we’re too busy.

For context, her reasons as to why can’t do something together for even a day are ridiculous because we are by no means a poor family. We live in a nice house and they regularly buy expensive superficial products for themselves and for me. As much as I really appreciate it, I just wish they wouldn’t buy me things and would instead spend their money on doing stuff as a family. I don’t understand what she means when she says we’re ‘too busy’ because all we do is sit inside, watch Netflix and eat.

It makes me feel like such a dick because every time I bring it up she tells me I’m being selfish and guilt tripping her.

I’ve suggested inexpensive day trips to my parents (nearby theme park, museum with very small entry fee) but they never get past the ‘I’ll look into it’ stage.

Because my parents used to take me places and spend time with me when I was a kid, the way we’ve been for the past five or six years has been a very obvious shift. On one hand I feel bad for calling out my (very loving and supportive) parents but I can’t shake the feeling that it’s just unnatural to not leave the house at all, and then when we do, only for school/work/food shopping.",False,no assholes here,5,18,0
bgfd93,1556019773,WIBTA if I gave a flower to a stranger?,"Ok, this might sound simple but hear me out. I live near a big-box store and I visit almost every day for groceries and stuff. There’s a woman who works behind the “here, buy food from us because we don’t want you to leave” counter and I often buy food from there. Every time I’ve been in there she looks absolutely miserable, angry at...I dunno, her job or her life or something. As far as I’ve seen I’ve never seen her smile ever, including when she’s ringing me up - and since I know she’d probably get shit from a supervisor for “poor customer service” for that I think it’s fair to assume she’s going through something instead of just being rude. 

I was in there a couple days ago with a friend and they noticed her “don’t talk to me” vibe as well, and I mentioned that I kept meaning to bring her a flower. You know, something that might brighten her day and maybe take the edge off of whatever’s going on in her life. (I’m kinda absent minded or I would’ve done it already - it’s one of those things I keep forgetting until I walk in and see her.) My friend responded that this was an absolutely terrible idea.

Their logic (and I’m trying to be comprehensive here, hopefully I hit all their basic points) is that I don’t know what’s going on in this person’s head. This person may be dealing with something really tough and their way of dealing with it could be being in a bad mood. By giving her a flower I’m obligating her (whether that’s my intention or not) to smile and be friendly to me, so I could make her feel worse. If she needs emotional support she probably has friends or family for that who know her better, so I should stay out of it.

c9xwtj,1562443184,AITA for publicly asking a neighbour to stop smoking weed in the garden all day.,"So firstly it's worth pointing out I'm in the UK.
How the houses I live in are situated they all go round in a circle so everyone's gardens back on to each other and all the houses are 3 story. Over the last week we have had a heat wave and there's been next to no wind during the days. A new neighbour of mine has just moved in within the last month. 

The new neighbour smokes weed which I don't have a problem with, ive personally messed about with it in the past ( who hasnt) but what I do have a problem with is that they do it all day every day in the garden to the point it stinks everyone out,the last week especially there's been next to no wind and I've had to shut all my Windows and doors because it's literally stinking my house out. 

I've politely asked them to stink there own house out by doing it inside or just be more respectful to everyone else and just do it in the evenings or something so everyone can enjoy the summer sun and gardens. They carried on smoking all day every day. 

In the last week I've had my nieces over for a visit and because its hot weather wise, my niece wanted to play in the garden which I've had to refuse because once again it literally stinks and she has bad asthma which I didn't want to risk flaring up. I've also had the health visitor over as I'm pregnant and they do sleep chats and checks on the nursery and crib, when she walked in she could smell it, she did a co2 breath test on me because she assumed id been smoking it, to which I took her in to garden to prove otherwise. 

I've considered if they was using it for medical reasons and it's not it's purely just to get high. (Found out by another neighbour). 

This morning when I woke up at around 7.30am i could smell it in my bedroom, I looked out of my window to find they was already up smoking it in their garden. I don't want to get people in trouble so I don't want to have to report them to the police, that's literally the last thing I want, so there's a closed off private group on Facebook with us all in to keep up to taps with everything going on, so I put: 

""I get it's each to their own and you can do as you wish on private property, but when it's going to be another hot day and I have to keep my Windows and doors shut all day because of the aroma, can we not be smoking substances in the garden all day for us all to be smelling please? Just have a little respect for others, After all there is a new born baby and kids in the area that will want to play in the sunshine too! Maybe just do it in the evenings or inside?""  

I didn't name anyone but jeez the backlash of comments I got off them was unreal, i got told to move, ""mind my own fucking business"" , then private threats too. I would love to move recently because of it but it's not that easy to just up and move.

d6wey2,1568992791,AITA if I tell my stepmom her son being a slob is her fault,"2 weeks ago I got a job in NYC, me and my family live in Upstate NY. I’ve been staying with my grandma so I can make it to work on time and go to school too. Before I got the job I would stay home and only go down to the city when I needed to go to college, so on my free days I would stay and clean. 

Me and my stepbrother (he’s 16)  share a bathroom together and a hallway, I usually clean our area because I hate having a mess. Problem is, the 2 weeks that I wasn’t home, I arrived last night to an awful mess. There was blood in the shower (my stepbrother gets nose bleeds a lot ) stains on the toilet, a toilet that hasn’t been flushed, hair on the walls and in the tub, gum on the sink edge, hair products out of their cabinets and soap box carton next to the trash bin instead of inside of it. Hallway has candy wrappers on the floor and it’s dusty enough to cause me to sneeze. 

Angered, I called my stepmom upstairs to see the state that her son has left the bathroom. I told her since I won’t be here as much anymore that her son is going to have to pick up part of his slack (the only chores that he does is clean his room and take the garbage out)  and that he needs to clean the bathroom because I am not picking up after him. The mess wasn’t mine after all so she was understanding last night about it and told me she was going to have a talk with him. So I let it go, didn’t use the bathroom because it was nasty and went straight to sleep.

It was until this morning, that I received a message from her, in a group chat with me her and her son, to “address the situation” by leaving a long text of how we are both responsible for cleaning the bathroom and that I as the adult, he must follow along my steps blah blah blah. Point was, she was shifting the blame of how disgusting the bathroom was, on both of us. 

I didn’t leave the bathroom in that state when I left home 2 weeks ago so I feel like I shouldn’t be responsible for cleaning it. He doesn’t do much of the house chores, and barely cleans himself. He does the bare minimum in school too since he’s always skipping classes. He doesn’t have much responsibility and there for I feel like he should be the one cleaning his mess.

It upsets me that she wants to blame me as well, acting like I make as much as a mess like him, which I don’t because I never raised that way. 

My stepbrother doesn’t respect his mom and makes her do most of his chores (even after witnessing that mess, instead of making him clean it, she’s decided to do it herself). He will never take her seriously because she doesn’t punish him by grounding him and taking away privileges, he doesn’t know the consequences of his actions. 

I’m considering telling her off, because she always complains to me how she’s worried for his future and how much of a slob he is. But I feel like she’s hugely to blame because he wouldn’t be like this if it weren’t for her irresponsibility.

I was considering how to handle it when he revealed that the sunglasses in question were $180 discontinued sunglasses.

b0ze8f,1552564290,AITA for not forgiving someone who won't apologize?,"Last January my best friend called me and asked if I wanted to rent an apartment together this spring when my lease is up. I asked him wasn't he still planning on buying a house and he said no, he wanted to rent with me. I said yes and we began discussing budgets and timelines. Fast forward to this month I suggested an apartment for us to check out. He said ""Oh I am considering buying in a few months."" I said we agreed to rent together. He said ""Yeah but I didn't *100%* say I was renting."" But that's bullshit, he asked me if I wanted to rent in the spring and I said yes. 

So we've been going back and forth for a couple days now. He refuses to admit that we made an agreement and that he changed his mind. People are allowed to change their minds but he was inconsiderate for not telling me as I already passed up living with someone else because of our plans. But even worse is his refusal to apologize, he simply won't accept that he did anything wrong.

Now he is my best friend and has been there for me more than most. But I don't want to drop this without an apology because I think he is blatantly wrong. I really think he has a blindspot, like he isnt capable of accepting blame for something. He did something really fucked up to me when we were in college and it took him a year to apologize for that.

There's always toys scattered everywhere, and piles of junk mail and miscellaneous other crap. She vacuums maybe once a month, cleans the bathrooms once every 3 months or so, and never dusts or washes windows or anything like that. 

I have confronted her about this MANY times. Here's how it goes:

Denial - excuses - anger - tears - she apologizes and promises to do better - about a week of actual effort - backsliding - right back to square one.

I have really nice headphones. They’re not technically “noise cancelling” but damn they block out a TON of noise. I pretty much wear them the whole flight, wether or not I’m listening to music. I have a pikachu pillow (I am 30 thanks) to squeeze, I have gum to chew, phone games to play and medicine to take etc. my routine is get on the flight, and try to distract myself for the duration of the flight with busy work (games, podcasts, silly putty, or more often than not a combination of multiple things.) 

I cry on planes. It’s part anxiety and part emotion (I’m always leaving family). I’m also quite obviously pregnant. Even when I’m NOT flying I’m introverted. But I get intensely anxious on planes and want to be left alone. I sit in my seat and don’t talk to anyone and give off nice big “don’t talk to me” vibes quite well. No offense to the extroverts, I’m just not interested. 

Today I sat (window) by a woman (middle) and I could tell there was going to be trouble. She had no book, smart phone, tablet or headphones and was already chatting up another reluctant  passenger (aisle- also with headphones and trying to read a book). One of those ladies who seems to love to go on planes to talk the whole time. No judgement, my husbands and mother are the same way. Normally they’re my willing and happy buffers but today I was alone. 

Everything was fine until aisle girl fell asleep. I had taken a headphone out to order a drink and middle seized her opportunity. She asked if I was going home or leaving it. I politely answered. She asked what part of the city I lived in, I answered. She asked if I liked living there. I answered while putting my headphones in. Still smiling and polite mind you, while turning towards the window. She asked another question that I could not hear due to headphones. But I knew she asked it. I really didn’t want to take my headphones back out (and risk a flight long conversation) so I just....kept looking out the window and pretended not to hear. She didn’t seem upset or angry, just somewhat disappointed and bored. 

I told my husband and he says I was TA for not addressing it directly and just putting my headphones in. I can totally see that... but also I know I was giving off “please no one talk to me” vibes.

dnaso3,1572075966,AITA for complaining to my roommate about her dad visiting?,"My roommate and I moved across the country this past July. We settled into a one bedroom apartment because of convenience/ timing and the nature of my roommates (RM) job at the time. Originally, RM was going to be away for months at a time. When she would be back home, I would sleep in our living room so she could have much needed privacy. Her job would have had her on a boat surrounded by people constantly.

That job fell through and we had already signed a lease for a one bedroom so right now I sleep on a mattress in the corner of the living room. We are both making this work and it's not too bad.

RM's dad wants to fly over here to visit for a week. This I wouldn't have any issues with except he wants to stay with us... in our one bedroom apartment... which we still haven't really furnished...

I think it is kind of rude to visit right now because we are still getting really settled in. RM is still looking for a job and we will both be busy during the week he wants to visit. This whole plan was made by him two days ago and he plans on visiting in two weeks. We only have two beds, no couch and nothing really saved up to buy extra furniture at this time. 

I complained to RM about how inconvienent it is and she seemed upset about my reaction. She is very close to her family and was sad about not getting to spend the holidays with then this year. I am pretty distant with my family and will rarely spend holidays with mine. 

Overall, I think RM's dad is being inconsiderate to our current situation and he should either postpone his trip or get a hotel room.

TL/DR: one bedroom apartment, roommates dad wants to visit and stay with us. Two beds no couch, we moved across country this past July.

bt6131,1558863126,AITA for not tipping at an expensive spa?,"To begin - I believe in businesses paying a living wage. I live in a city with a $16 minimum wage. I vote for living wages and social services. HOWEVER I understand that tips exist to supplement the wages at places where employers do not pay a living wage. This is stupid, but I tip. I am traveling and not currently in my city. 

&#x200B;

I'm staying at a spa hotel. Rooms are $300-500/night. It is a one-time treat, not a regular thing for me. I tipped the dude who transported my bags to my room. I tip housekeeping. I did not tip the dude who brought my room service breakfast. The hotel charges a delivery fee, and a 15% gratuity. So I did not add a tip to the already charged gratuity. 

&#x200B;

My question - I had a spa treatment - I have literally never been to a spa except for one pedicure which someone else paid for but I understand that estheticians typically get tips. HOWEVER. This was a facial treatment. One hour. For which the establishment charged $200. As I said it is a one-time treat and this, to me, is exorbitantly expensive for a person to rub my face. I will totes rub your face for $200/hr. Anyway, I didn't tip. And I feel like an asshole. I get that the spa may not be paying this person a reasonable wage, and she may depend on tips. HOWEVER - $200? For one hour? I'm not worried about you. Negotiate your rate. Get paid. I should not have to supplement a $200/hr charge. Am I being unreasonable?

ETA: I just checked out and the mothefuckers added $40 to my bill. THEY ARE THE ASSHOLES. Decision rendered. 

I went and told them that it isn't a gratuity if I don't have the option of not paying it.

bngsml,1557607490,AITA for telling my neighbour off after he tried to make me pay for the garden.,"So I live in a 6 flat (apartment) tenement building, 3 floors, 2 flats to a floor. 

The tenement has a communal back garden and storage shed. My neighbour booked a a guy to cut the grass without asking me or anyone else and expects us to cover his cost every month. 

I am taking my bin out this morning and bump into my neighbour who lives across from me. 

He tells me it's nice to meet me and welcome to the building (even though I have been here a year and a half and we have actually had multiple conversations but, whatever). Then he says ""I have been meaning to speak to you, I have hired a gardener to come and now the back lawn for us. He is charging £30 so I need £5 from each building"". 

I say ""excuse me, you did what?""

He repeats himself. I ask why he did that. He said because the garden needs mowing. I say to him that we have a shared lawnmower and we have a rota for mowing the lawn that we all agreed too. 

He says that it doesn't look professional. I say it isn't supposed to because we aren't professionals but the grass is cut. 

He says he wants it professionally cut. I say ""cool, but I'm not paying for a gardner that I knew nothing about. I don't care if it's £5 a month. I'm not paying someone to do something I do every 6 months for free and my neighbours do in the intervening 5 for free"". 

He says ""actually flat F doesn't have anyone in it now so it's between five of us. Which means it's actually £6 each. I'll pay £7 cos I booked him"". 

I say ""no, you'll pay £13 because I'm not giving you £6 a month. You booked him without consulting me. I already pay £25 for tenement fees (which includes repairs to the lawnmower and fuel for it) a month. I'm not paying any more"". 

He gets upset. Says he can't afford £13 a month. I said tough, that's what happens when you just commit the tenement to a financial agreement without speaking to anyone else that lives here. He says it's only £5. I say I don't care. Its extra money I don't need to pay. I don't sign up to anything I don't need or want. Period. 

I spoke to two other neighbours since then, and neither of them were consulted either. And neither want to pay it (though one just caved and agreed too).

I (44M) currently live with my only son Brian (23M). Me and his mom broke up when he was 4 and I got full custody of him since his mom was unemployed  and doing drugs after he was born. She’s been in and out of his life since. She makes some contact, but not enough. Until he was old enough to be home alone, my mom would watch him. While he was growing up, I’ve tried to teach him to be responsible for himself, since I was always out at work and not home to be with him. He was always a big kid, but it was never a problem. 

When he got to high school, he joined the football team and began to lose the weight. He even started going to the gym regularly to build muscle. In his senior year, he got kicked off the team for bad grades. Around this time, my mom passed away, which I believe hit him the hardest since they were super close. 

Months later he started to lose all his motivation and stopped doing everything he used to do. He did graduate (late) but then he started to put on a lot of weight and smoke pot. I tried to encourage him to get a job and apply for college. He assured me he was but it never happened. I didn’t want to intervene because he is an adult and I couldn’t force him to do anything. 

Come last week, he texted me while I was at work asking me if I can take him to the mall and buy him new clothes because his current ones don’t fit anymore. I told him I would, but I can’t afford it right now. I did say I’d get him a few shirts and a pair of pants at Walmart, but he wanted to go buy things only at the mall. 

After a minute of talking, He refused to get anything from Walmart and only things from the mall. I got annoyed and said “maybe if you got off your ass and got a job, you wouldn’t have to ask me to buy you shit.” He hung up and called his mom, to which she then texted me a whole bunch of bs saying I fat shamed him and I’m just bullying him. I told her that I never mentioned his weight, but apparently he thinks I did. She told me if I didn’t get him what he “needs”, she will, to which I said go ahead. I’m not sure if I’m right to stick to my guns or if I’m just being an ass by not getting him what he wants.

I placed an order online with Domino’s for a pretty standard pizza and set it to delivery with payment as “cash.” The tracker online said ""35-45 minutes."" (They close at 11:00)

1 hour has passed. I called to check on the status of the pizza. The manager answered the phone and asked what I would like to eat. I mention my order number, the estimated time, and what the ETA was. The manager replied, ""oh, that was just sent out; you should get your pizza soon."" 

30 minutes go by and no pizza has arrived, and the online tracker is now bugged. I call again and get the same manager. I explain to her that I was the guy who called earlier and I am checking in on the pizza. She then tells me, ""Oh, the driver said you canceled that order."" To which I matter of factly say, ""No, I didn't."" She then told me she would check with the driver but then hung up. I call in again and she instantly picked up the phone and hung up. This happened 3 more times. I then call and get put into a hold where domino's promotions are just looping. 

I simply order a new pizza from hot box and decide to stop by Domino’s on my way there.

I make my way to their building, and I see: chairs on tables, oven off, one driver sitting and texting, and the manager texting at the counter. I then call from my cell. Manager looks at the phone, eyes the screen, and lets out a very visible sigh. She hung up the phone instantly while the driver looked up and laughed. 

I casually walked in and went up to the counter. She looked up from her phone and asked what I would like. I say in a low, snide tone, ""I would like “X” pizza, oh wait, that's actually the pizza I ordered from hot box because you guys are so incompetent that you couldn't deliver a pizza in 2 hours or see fit to answer your phones, have a good night."" Two middle fingers on my way out. As I'm driving away, both the manager and driver come out and flip me off to which I return the favor. I then drove to hot box. 

I pull into a side street to park on the curb, and the man in the car behind me honks. I figure I just took someone’s parking spot. As I put my car in park and get out, it's none other than the driver. He then gets out of his car and says, ""Where do you get off talking to my manager like that!"" I don't think I've ever been angrier in my entire life. I screech, ""YOU GUYS FUCK UP THAT BADLY AND HAVE THE AUDACITY TO BITCH WHEN YOU GET CALLED OUT; ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?!"" Taken back, he mutters ""Well, you're not welcome at Domino's anymore."" To which I rail, ""ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED?

Edit: A few details based on the thread and what I've read. 1. I am a man, not sure how I became a she. 2. I did not yell in the store, only on the road 3. Only the manager and delivery man were there in the store, and I only spoke to the manager",1558377902.0,not the asshole,6805,861,0

cjsw5w,1564498581,AITA for distancing myself from my mother?,"The whole incident happened about 6 months ago. My wife and I had our first child last year and could not be happier. Both sides of our family were excited  because this was the first grandbaby in the family. My mother was especially excited. She was the typical mom, always asking when we would give her a grandbaby.  She offered to babysit our son once he was born due to both my wife and I working. We graciously accepted. The thought of the child being in the care of family and saving over $1,000 dollars a month on daycare was a good feeling.


Now for the fight. We went over to my parents house for dinner. I could tell things were tense already. My mother could never hide her temper. After eating and the usual talk and playing with the baby my mother flipped out. She asked if I even trusted her to watch the kid. She started yelling about how all we do is  seclude her from seeing my son. I also have a temper and started to raise my voice while defending myself. She started saying how I have no problems in my life and I was self centered. There was more outlandish accusations but for the sake of my thumbs I'll move on.


At this point my wife tells me she is going to take our son outside because she doesnt want him in the room with all the yelling. That's when my mother yells at her and says she is a ""drama mama"" and she needs to suck it up. That's when I snap. I tell my mother to go fuck herself and she is a piece of shit. I  told her she needs some mental help and i can recommend a few doctors. My wife and I leave the house with my son and head home.


2 weeks later we still had no contact until she called me at work. She apologized for what she started and what she said. I also apologized. She said she still wants to watch our son and I told her that that was not necessary. We already enrolled him in a daycare. She took that pretty hard but It was for the best.


So it has been the better part of 6 months and both me and my wife are still uneasy about the situation. We don't go out of our way to spend time over at my parents house. We do the occasional dinner but it is always weird.

So am I the asshole for keeping my distance from my mother?


Edit- For the people asking why she got angry out of nowhere. She has a history of just flipping out and leaving everyone asking what it was about. In this situation the only reason she gave was that we were  not giving her enough time with my son. She said we were excluding her. This was said durning the argument. Afterwards, when she called to apologize she said she was just sensitive. Hope that clears some things up.",1564499154.0,not the asshole,6,25,0

However she won't exercise much, and if I encourage her to go for a walk (1 hour I say, with a podcast, just tune out and relax and walk) she gets annoyed. Or rather has started becoming annoyed as I continue to suggest it. She goes to exercise classes, but these don't really seem to even begin to come close to just an hours deliberate walking in terms of effort. She is trying a mum and babies class, weekly, and even in that she was complaining how they didn't do much as the instructor kept having to run after her baby instead of teach.

So to me it seems there's the obvious benefit of getting far more, and far more immediate, exercise. How can that not be a positive? But she just seems to keep avoiding it, even with the evenings getting lighter she won't go out alone in our very safe village... She's getting annoyed when I suggest it, stating I'm being patronising etc., but increasingly it feels like she's taking this position in order to just avoid doing it?

d7j6vr,1569112353,WIBTA - if I told my classmate to stop blowing his nose in class?,"There’s a guy in my class who is very unhygienic. He clearly doesn’t shower and rarely ever changes his clothing. I’ve seen his butt crack more times than my own at this point. His hands are so sticky you can see the finger prints after he touches paper and he smells like death. Like my dog after she has rolled in a dead bird.

He’s been sick the past two weeks but still goes to school. The entire row in front of his seat has been sick for a week now. May be a coincidence but whatever. He always blows his nose IN class. And it’s not like just a small, quiet blow to just remove a bit of liquid. It’s full on trumpet and you can hear every drop of slime leave his nose. It has us all gagging. In my country we eat lunch in the same classroom.

Last Friday I saw snot fall from his nose, into his lap after he blew it. Half of the class turned their face away from him and visibly gagged.

He doesn’t have any friends in this class because of the things I described and he makes everyone uncomfortable with the things he says. So there’s really no one to tell him to stop.

One day during lunch he blew his nose right in front of me, and my entire group of friends gagged. I got up, said loudly “it’s honestly so damn disgusting and rude that anyone would blow their nose IN class.” And then I walked out. This was probably a dick move but I didn’t want to ‘confront’ him or for him to feel like I did.

Everyone else goes to the toilet to blow their nose etc. He clearly heard what I said and yet he continues to do it. Even my teachers are disgusted.

I want to add that I don’t expect him to stay home if he feels well enough to go to school. I’m talking about blowing his nose and coughing out into the open instead of into his arm etc.

She moved in with me again about three weeks ago.

During the first stint, I worked my ass off to provide a stable environment for her. And on the surface, things were okay. But she often followed the *letter* of the rules, but not the spirit. I had a strict ""no-drug"" rule in the house, which she broke multiple times until she learned to just keep it out of the house. Still did them, though, even though she knew that ""no drugs in the house"" meant ""no drugs, period"" and ""get your shit together."" Which she didn't.

First week she's back, she smokes pot twice in the first week. I told her I don't want her here if she's just going to pull the same stuff she did last time. And... we've had multiple ""discussions"" about her getting it together (me lecturing, mostly). When we talk about that stuff, she's either silent or changes the subject.

Friday morning she was crying about her ex. She got paid Friday afternoon and ten minutes later, was out the door. Stayed out all night and didn't come home until yesterday evening. I took her key from her last night and told her she has 30 days to leave. I know I told her earlier she could stay until she saves up for her own place, but at the rate she's going, I'll be 92 when she's ready to go. I have my own life and I can't spend the rest of it trying to prop her up.

But there's a lot of guilt and emotions wrapped up in this because she had a shitty childhood and I lived out of state during that period. Always felt like I should've known since I was my brother's favorite punching bag growing up. But she also emphatically denied any abuse and had chances to leave that she didn't take. (Later, she admitted there was, and that's why she came to live with me.) So there's a lot of psychological problems there that I know I can't fix. Or, at least I know that now. 

But after taking her key away (I don't want her to make a copy of it), I feel terrible. I love this kid something fierce.

The guys at the furniture company did a nice job on our friends' place, and they weren't crazy expensive either, so we decided to go for it. 

Now, our flat has many quirks: it's in an old building, none of the walls are straight, we have strict quite times due to the neighbors, etc. 

We told the furniture company all these things. But from the start, the guys were very unprofessional. They always took ages to reply (the longest was 1 month, when they claimed that our emails had 'accidentally' gone into spam). They took very bad measurements, and as such, had to refit every bit of furniture several times, because they put it either too high or too low. They always showed up to work very late (around noon, even though they confirmed they would be there at 8AM). They were very messy, managed to scratch our walls and floors in several places, as well as smear blood on the furniture (one of the guys cut himself, but instead of asking for a bandage, he just continued working).

Now, we were home the entire time they were fitting things, not in the same room, but close by. This wasn't ideal, but after the 1st day, we decided to take time off work to 'babysit' the guys while they were fitting stuff.

We did offer feedback on what they did each day, and even asked them to redo several things. The guys seemed friendly and such, but in spite of talking these over with them, we still felt like we were scammed.

I (28) have been together with my boyfriend (28) for about 5+ years. Talking about our future plans, we had a discussion about our potential wedding. My boyfriend is ambivalent to having his brother/sister to be a part of the wedding party (bridesmaid, groomsmen, MOH, BM, etc.), mostly because his siblings don't really care too much about being a part of that stuff. The decision to have any siblings in the wedding party is pretty much riding on whether to include my sister. I know **traditionally**, the siblings and future siblings-in-law should be included in the wedding party.

But, if it was straightforward, I wouldn't be asking you all. So here's some backstory to this. 

&#x200B;

My sister and I were never really close. She's a few years older than me but has always been stirring up trouble. She is a recovering drug addict but has relapsed numerous times just in the past six months alone. She's been struggling with her addiction for more than a decade and (from the looks of it) does not plan to take her addiction seriously. She also has some mental health issues that she refuses to address. Although it seems cold at times, I keep her at an arm's length because of this. Addiction is a crippling disease and it has taken a toll not only on my sister, but the rest of my family as well. The one lesson I've learned these past ten years is that I cannot cure my sister.

I'm not ashamed of my sister. I'm actually deeply saddened that I don't feel close enough with her, like most siblings should. I want to support her as much as I can, but only if she wants to change. I'm planning on inviting her to the actual wedding, but I don't want her to be a part of my wedding party.

Basically what happened is A's birthday was coming up tmr, and C told me A invited me to his party and all his friends are coming. Since A is a cool guy i accepted the ""invitation"" (note that A hasnt told me anything personally, he always delivers messages with C though since he always comes over to our house)

So at 8pm i arrived at his house with C and B but he wasnt there, C said that he was buying cake with a friend and theyre all gonna be back soon (suspicious but okay)

eventually i kept waiting until 10pm, kept trying to call A but he never picked up, eventually he came home but with his family only, his family was shocked to see me there at night in the cold and just greeted and went up with C to their home in a hurry (???)

they went up without telling me to go up with them, thats when i took this as a hint that i wasnt invited and tried to leave, B though didnt listen to me and just followed after them

i couldnt just leave without B in the cold with no way to go back, and ill not stay down to freeze so i just came up as well. as expected turns out this is a family only birthday and no one was invited, no friends no nothing

A and his father was visibly irritated that i was there, rest of family was very uncomfortable. i tried to leave as soon his possible but his nan AND STUPID B didnt let me until we ate desert.

so there i was completely uninvited and making a personal family birthday party uncomfortable. A excused to leave to buy some groceries (at 10:30pm??) and just left early

i wanted to die and just excused myself as well and yanked B and took him home

I just want to start this off by saying I am 9 months pregnant and my due date is tomorrow. We have currently been going through some relationship problems that have taken a toll on the both of us. Today he kinda just broke down and said he couldn't handle the stress. His original plan was to go have a few drinks with his friend- but he was busy. So instead he is planning on going to our property (20 acre ranch in the making, we still live in town currently) and shooting off a few rounds and letting off some steam (we often go rabbit hunting. It is a family past time so it isn't an out of character thing for him to do)
We haven't really spent any time together in the past two weeks and I was really looking forward to spending some quality time with him tonight. We had plans to drive out and watch the meteor shower, but due to him getting frustrated with the problems we are going through, our two year old and I will be here at home by ourselves while he goes out.

drz4j3,1572960436,WIBTAS If I didn't change the 1 star review I gave an Amazon seller?,"So I bought this modem from a seller on Amazon and when it got here it was clearly an ISP locked router, the normal version I would be able to change the settings and do all kinds of things its a nice router, but since its ISP locked the ISP changes the firmware and everything, they put a sticker over the serial and MAC address and everything. Most importantly they changed the default username and password so you cant access anything, even if you flash the memory it will go back to ISP settings (not that I should have to do that anyways but I tried).

So I tell the seller that and they have no clue whats going on they just give me the default user and pass (the one on the bottom of the router that no longer works because the ISP changed it) so I tell him whats up and he says he has no clue about any of it. Needless to say there was no description of the products that said any of this and the seller clearly didn't check the product before selling it so I left a 1 star review. Well he messages me this long story asking me to change the review and Id post the transcript but I cant with the 3000 word limit on my post so ill just say he replies basically begging me to change the review. An excert for you “Negative feedbacks are very damaging to our account, and will really hurt our business and will affect our employees as well. I do apologize for the issue with the modem, but want you to know, that this is a very isolated experience.” He goes on to blame the supplier and says its isolated which I accept but I still think if you mess up you should be willing to accept what happens.
Okay great they got it from someone else and thought it was all good, but still it's like selling a car whos dash VIN didn't match the engine VIN and then saying you had no clue the car was hot (stolen) because the guy you bought it from never mentioned it.

So I message him and say Im sorry but if you sell something you have to be aware and its not like it was hard to tell, the ISP literally put stickers over the serial and MAC address, which is a big indication they changed the firmware.

So I already sent it back and bought another one from a different seller and he messages me back that he will send a better one if I leave a better review, but I already sent it back and got a new one so I wasn't going to go through the hassle so I said I already sent it back and bought from another seller and now hes offering me $20 to change my review.

dhy6kb,1571091745,AITA for being angry at my Mom for walking in and out when she cheated?,"So I'm 20 and live in my family home, around June my Mom cheated on my dad with a work colleague of both of theirs (they work in the same place together) a thing that had apparently been going on for months via text but had finally become physical when my Mom went away with her friend. My Mom confessed this to my Dad who was obviously traumatised. My Dad has had some big issues with gambling in the past and my Mom tried to use that against him to flip the situation. She then decided she needed space and moved out around 2 months ago which I understood, she continued to see this other guy she'd cheated on my dad with who is trying, bless him, to keep everything together. 

Around a week ago my Mom just burst in out of the blue into the house with no warning and was acting like it never happened, talking to us both normally and such, we even spent the next day eating pizza in our PJ's. I knew my Dad wouldn't have wanted any drama because my Mom was really worried that my dad had 'turned me against her', which hasn't happened, it's their relationship and it's not mine to judge or fix, if they begin to act differently as parents that's when I should be concerned. 

Tonight my Dad text me to say my Mom was back home while I was out and in all honesty I was annoyed. I had to cycle back on my ancient torture device of a bike in pouring rain and was in a bad mood because of this, and knocked on the door; out of breath and tired. My Mom answers the door and proceeds to make monster noises at me like she has done since I was a Kid, probably expecting me to be okay with her just showing up again without any warning or telling either me or my Dad as I was a couple days before. I let my anger get the better of me and just said 'Yes. I know you're here, I saw the car in the driveway' without looking at her in a pretty annoyed tone. She then announced she was going to bed straight away, having been sat with my Dad before I came in. My Dad tells me to go and say Hello and I go on a very quiet yet annoyed rant as to how I shouldn't have to because it's not fair of her to just be walking in and out of the house when she pleases as if nothing ever happened. Guilt gets the better of me and I go to say hello not 3 minutes later but her head's under the covers and she doesn't respond, pretending to be asleep, obviously upset I didn't react well to her being home. 

At the end of the day she's my Mom and I love her, she's a good Mother and it's not my relationship to try intrude on even if they are my parents but I got annoyed today when she just walked straight back in again as if nothing ever happened. I did let my annoyance get the better of me and could have probably handled the situation better, I absolutely hate upsetting people even if they're in the wrong, but part of me is telling me not to be guilty because my anger seems reasonable.

cm3qpw,1564964196,WIBTA for telling my roommate I don't want to talk to him?,"I am going to college this fall. I am an introvert, and social interaction, especially pointless social interaction for the purpose of exchanging pleasantries and nothing more, tires me out greatly. I have had my own room for most of my life, and I realize how much of a luxury this is whenever I am forced to stay in a room with other people for any extended period of time. I have discovered that I need long periods of alone time (6+ hours) in order to feel mentally well. I realize that, in college, I won't be able to be alone that often. The next best thing, I have realized, is basically trying to ""trick"" my brain into forgetting that the other person is there, by ignoring them unless necessary. 

This is where the potentially asshole behavior comes in. I had decided that I was going to tell my roommate that I don't want to talk to them unless absolutely necessary. Now I know nothing about my roommate at this point, so it's obviously not a personal thing. I planned to explain everything I said in this post, and that it's not personal, it's just for my mental wellbeing. I wasn't going to ignore him maliciously: if they needed me for whatever reason, I wouldn't ignore him. I would also talk as much as is needed to decide how we're going to coexist and to solve any potential disputes. I would just ask that he not expect me to say hello when he enters the room or chat about our classes or whatever. I don't want to be friends, or even friendly, with my roommate. I want to be cordial and considerate, but not friendly. I mean, I have a friend from high school going to my college, and rooming with him would drive me crazy because I would feel more of an obligation to talk to someone I considered a friend. With someone who's not my friend, I can just forget they're even there most of the time, so that's how I'd like to keep my roommate relationship. 

I thought that this would be mutually beneficial. I mean, who wants to talk to some random person all the time, right? But when I told my parents about my view, they thought it was not only weird (which I will admit) but assholish. They said that my roommate would likely report me to someone if I were to do this, and that I should strive to compromise more. I mean this person will likely have a social life, it's not my responsibility to comfort him or be nice to him (and I mean go out of my way to be kind, I don't intend to be malicious in any way) just because we're forced to live together. I mean for all my parents know, my roommate might be as happy as I would be about this arrangement I want to have. But even assuming he isn't, WIBTA here if I told him what I want? I want my room to feel like ""home"", and even though going to some place like the library is an option, I'd rather have a quiet room to retreat back to at the end of the day.

She's staying with a new hookup (very adamantly not a boyfriend - they are ""just having fun"") and her kids are living there part time with her, and part time at their old house with her husband.

I hadn't seen her in awhile and I was hanging with her and her two youngest at her old house while her husband was at work.  She was telling me how this new guy didn't like having the kids around - making comments about how it's too much, etc.  She mentioned that she could move into another wing of her old house while she and her ex figure out what they are going to do.

She was really doubtful and pessimistic about everything. 
 I told her that I thought it wasn't a good situation to have her kids in an that she should either move out and get her own place or have her kids stay in their old house.  

She got really quiet and started crying.  I felt really bad for making her cry.  I support her in getting out of her marriage if thats what she wants to do, or staying in it if thats what she wants to do.

So i’ve had this best friend, who ill name Ashley, for about 3-4 years now and she’s always been kind of a flake and on top of that she’s been on and off with an abusive boyfriend (who i’ve told school counselors about sent in police tips and begged her to break up with) that doesn’t let her go out with friends. 

This month is prom and as I graduated early i still have a lot of friends in high school (i’m 17F graduated a year ago for context) my friend, who i’ll name Jack, asked me to his prom a month ago and was really excited when i said i’d join him. About 2 weeks ago Ashley asked me to her prom and since they attend different schools i said sure but didn’t realize they were on the same day so when i woke up the next day i told her i couldn’t just bail on Jack.

For some more context we’d been making plans for the past year and she’d act excited to hang out until it came to the actual day and just didn’t message me at all. At that point i decided since Jack asked me first and i already made plans to go with him i would refuse her offer.

She didn’t like this very much. Called me some names then removed me off every social media site.

dnuxs6,1572190377,"AITA for making my mom ""fat""","So this is an issue that has been going on for a while now having to do with me(17M) and my mom(44).  

Over the last few months I have been interested in cooking.  I've been baking, cooking, making dinner almost every night (And actually very good recipes mind you).  This entire process has been underlined by some push back from my mom periodically.  Sometimes she'll be totally on board with whatever I'm making, and other times, things like today happen.  

Just a little backstory:

My mom has tried to lose weight in the past, and did quite a bit last year.  I did it too and lost a good amount of weight myself.  We both kinda stopped doing it and gained back some of the weight. Randomly I'll be confronted with outbursts about how I am the reason why she is gaining weight again.  She'll say that my recipes are not what she should be eating and she can't stop herself from eating them/ eating too much of them.  I find this particularly bs because I'm on the same diet as her, and I have lost 6 pounds so far while continuing my cooking as usual (thought I know obviously everyone is different).  Not to mention the whole point of this diet is to continue eating what you normally eat, but just to watch portion control by counting calories.  

What happened today:

Today's a Sunday so I wake up a little later, and watch some cooking videos like usual.  I find this awesome recipe for a homemade vodka sauce and rigatoni, and really want to try it out.  I talk to my dad about it and he seems on board, and then just ask my mom if she would want any (yah know common courtesy).  I guess that was my mistake? She explodes at me saying how she can't handle me making all this food.  She blames me for her eating too much of a pumpkin bread I made last week (most of which I gave away to friends at school btw, as I know it isn't great to have in the house).  And says that not only is she gaining weight but I am gaining weight from all of this. (Side note, I have tried to help out with this in the past by giving the majority of things I make away to friends at school.  When I make a cake or something, which rarely happens, I give away 90% of it the day after baking).

This isn't particularly abnormal, but the next part particularly pissed me off.  I bought up how making a pasta with tomato sauce isn't something horrendous, and mention how just earlier this week she made pesto for everyone, which is just as caloric if not more so.  She then explodes at me saying that it's my fault for making the pasta for said pesto that she made.  She claims that if I never made the pasta she would have just eaten some with some cauliflower rice instead.  At this point it just seems like she is trying to find someone to blame, and I'm the unlucky one.  

This just seems unfair to me, because i feel like its not my fault that my mom can't seem to control portion size, but of course I could be wrong.  AITA?",False,not the asshole,5,33,0

I keep pushing for my partner to contribute to bills, even though I make significantly more than she does. She has pushed back due to the difference in our incomes.

Before any gold digger comments pop up, this is an income I started making AFTER we had dated for some time. She is not that type of person.

In terms of income, I make about $7,500/month after taxes and she makes about $1,500/month.

Our bills together come out to about $2,500 - $3,000 per month (we live near a high cost major city). In recent months I've been pushing for her to contribute $300/month of her income towards our household expenses.

She takes jobs that offer about 20-30 hours a week and works for a few months, gets bored, then hops to another job. I want her to be happy and I know she is exploring things she may want to get further into, so I don't make too much fuss about it. She is also trying to save for a Real Estate training program she wants to do, but has done several other programs for different careers and dropped out.

In terms of housework, we split everything equally. We take turns with dishes, laundry, etc.

I'm not sure if I'm an asshole for pushing for her to pay $300/month when I make so much more than she does. After paying the bills, I still have $5,000/month leftover (mostly saved towards a house down payment) which is still triple her total income.

For me, it's not so much about the money but moreso feeling like she is also helping to contribute in some way. At the same time, I feel like an ass when there is such a huge gap in our income.

Anyway; my mom has 4 kids. None of us live at home. 2 of us have children (I have one and my sister has 4)

When we need to wash, I was at first going to the big laundromat because we have a lot of clothes and I tend to let the clothes pile (I knoowww. Bites me in the ass every time). My mom started insisting that we just wash at her house to save money for everyone. I wash about 3 times a month. And only 2-3 loads at a time.

I am the only one who brings my own soap and bleach. Everyone uses my mom's soap. I wash my clothes and she always ends up folding them. And that much i appreciate. The problem is, if I'm in a rush, I won't wash everything in one day so I tend to leave my soap and stuff there and let my mom know that I will be back.

I'm just now noticing today, that my sister with the 4 kids will wash multiple times a week but never brings her soap, but she's bringing large loads at a time.

When I called my mom to ask if I can bring the rest of my clothes by to wash, she asked if I had any soap because Trish (sister) used the last of it yesterday and she (my mom) won't have any money to replace it until tomorrow. I'm not able to wash tomorrow due to my schedule of school/work/then parenting.

I got mad. Not at my mom per say, just at my sister. My mom was apologetic about it but I said it wasn't her fault and she's not the one who needs to replace it.

Because the amount of soap I was buying doesn't correlate with how much I'm washing. My mom and I use 2 different soaps but I figured she was using my soap and had no issue with that.

I text my sister and told her that she needs to replace my soap because it's not cheap and I'm not responsible for her household. (She works for the post office Mon-Fri if that helps)

She told my dad and he said I'm being unreasonable and stingy because I can just wash tomorrow when my mom buys more soap. When explained about my schedule he says I'm just fishing for drama.

Instead I’m laying in bed and don’t really have any intention towards working today, because my entire body hurts and it sounds like she doesn’t need me. This is also the first sick day I’ve taken off in two years, because in general unless it’s stomach issues I don’t feel the need to take the day off. 

Am I the asshole for taking more time off than I need to?

d9tzqw,1569551042,AITA for telling my mom she’s choosing her love life over her kids?,"My (20F) father and mother separated last year, and officially got divorced in May-ish. It was for reasons I won’t go into now, but he’s not the stable parental figure. My sister and I still see him, as he lives in the same town, although I see him less since I’m now a sophomore in college.
Anyways, about 2-3 months ago, my mom started dating this guy, lets call him Bob. Now Bob is super accomplished, he was a professor, he’s an MD, an artist, a 2x Ju-jitsu world champion. Literally he sounds fake, but it’s real. He’s really nice, and I like him. He as two kids, a girl my sister’s age (a junior in hs) and a boy that’s a freshman in hs/8th grade (not entirely sure). They’re all really nice, but my mom is basically mushing us together into a giant family already. She either is over at his house, or him over at ours, almost every single night, completely ignoring the fact my sister is there. They came down to visit me at my college last weekend, and she wanted me to be a personal tour guide for the kids, even though I had spoken to them a grand total of 5 minutes, and she wasn’t interested in coming to the college. She also had the girl and one of her friends sleep over with my sister and I at my apartment here, so she and Bob could sleep together I guess. The final straw was today, when he asked my mom if he could text me. I had gotten a bad grade on a test, and was upset about it. He overheard when I was face timing my sister and she took me down to say hi to my mom. He texted me rude and unsolicited advice. I had also not given permission for him to text me, and it definitely made me uncomfortable, and overstepped my boundaries. My sister and I have expressed several times that we’re uncomfortable having him over so much, her spending so much time with him instead of my sister, having to be with his kids all the time, the whole coming down to visit me thing, etc. Every time we mention it, she basically says “well I deserve to be happy! You need to be nice!” She does, she’s an amazing mom. And I have been nothing but nice to Bob and his kids. I feel like she’s choosing her boyfriend over her children after only 3 months of dating. I feel like your kids should come before your love life. And after everything has changed so rapidly, I’m not ready to have another father just yet. Am I being the asshole here?

chtdl0,1564087954,"AITA for giving our waitress an ""impossible"" order?","There's this trend in the last several years of waiters and waitresses trying to memorize the order instead of just writing it down. There's one waitress we get at Denny's late at night that screws up the order every single time. And I don't mean forgetting the extra onion rings - someone will order a cake batter shake and she'll bring out an ice tea.

We finally said enough is enough the other night. We ordered roughly this kind of order:

Build-a-burger #1: beef patty on brioche bun, lettuce with no tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, mayo, seasoned fries

Build-a-burger #2: veggie patty on cheddar bun, no lettuce extra tomatoes, sauteed onions, bourbon sauce, regular fries

Build-a-burger #3: beef patty on cheddar bun, both lettuce and tomatoes, sauteed onions, mayo, regular fries

Unbelievably, she tried to keep this in her head. She came back a minute later and asked if the burger with the veggie patty had mayo. Then again to ask which burger had extra lettuce. Then about whether we had ordered onion rings.

When it finally comes out, of course it's an abortion. There were things on there we didn't even know Denny's could put on a burger. We had to send them back, *but she still didn't write anything down*. Then we hear straight up yelling from the kitchen in some sort of Eastern European accent.

It was a very hot day so we looked around for a bench in the shade. The only benches in the shade were already occupied. But we noticed an available bench inside a fenced-off portion of the park for off-leash dogs. We don’t have a dog, but we like dogs. The dog park was empty. There is only one bench in this dog park but there are also a few large logs and stumps available to sit on. 

I left to get us coffees and when I came back I saw a woman with a small dog speaking to my wife. As I entered the dog park I asked her what’s up? This is the conversation:

Her: “This is a dog park. It is for dogs. I recommend you sit on one of those benches over there.”

Me: “Those benches are occupied.”

Her: “OK but this area is a dog park, it is for dogs.”

Me: “Are you saying that we are not allowed to sit on a bench?”

Her: “Well no, of course you can sit where you want, I can’t stop you. But it I don’t think it’s fair. This is a dog park, it is for dogs.”

Me: “We like dogs. We can share the bench. There’s lots of places to sit.”

Her: “Yes but my dog doesn’t like other people.” 

Me: “Oh, OK then.” 

And then she walked away.

dhe9v8,1570990798,AITA for eating at a restaurant an hour and a half past close?,"My two friends and I went to a Thai restaurant last night. We were seated as soon as we walked in. Once someone came to take our orders, we noticed our waiter was extremely hostile and uninviting. Out of curiosity one of my friends looked up the hours online and it said they closed at 6. We walked in at 7:30. The open sign was glowing and turned on and there were two other tables eating as well. I’ve also eaten here plenty of times and they’ve always been open around the time we came in. We figured that since they didn’t tell us they were closed and since there were other tables, that maybe they didn’t update their hours online. The waiter was so hostile that it made us all nervous to ask him if they were closed- literally every time he walked past our table we told ourselves we’d ask but would freeze up whenever he actually was there. So once we got our food, we took a few bites, asked for to-go boxes and our checks and left pretty decent tips. 

On one hand, he was kind of rude, but on the other hand, I totally understand and I would also get annoyed if I was working at a restaurant that closed at 6 and I was still there at 7:30, so I see where he’s coming from and I don’t blame him for that.

atqv9f,1550893142,AITA for telling my ex she had some growing up to do?,"My last relationship had a lot of issues. Any small thing I would do would be enough to make her so mad she wouldn't speak to me for days, and I'm talking things like saying ""not bad"" after a workout instead of ""good job"" warranted the silence. There were absolutely times that I fucked up and she was right to be angry at me for, but I honestly feel like those were scarce as I generally just did my best to make her happy.
Everything became annoying to her, eventually she only half-jokingly threatened to slap me when I was telling her how I was feeling down about a workout because she said I had no reason to feel down based on how I'd measured it. 
Winter break comes, and things are weird. She breaks down crying during runs and I try to be there for her and encourage her. She hung up on me when I said something like ""yeah today was rough and it didn't go well but it's in the past so just get back out there tomorrow and go harder."" Apparently that was the wrong sentiment. One night, she tells me that she's not sure she wants to date anymore, and I told her to take her time to think about it and that I would support whatever decision she made. Every so often I ask her where she is on her decision, and she always says she hasn't made one. 
One day, we were supposed to go to an art gallery and meet to leave at 9:30. I'm in class until 9:15, a fact she knew but forgot this morning. So at 9:00, she asks when we're supposed to meet, and when I didn't reply she got sassy about it and just started walking to my car. I apologized when I saw the texts, told her sorry I was in class and on my way. I freely admit to being annoyed and decided to be a little sassy back, saying ""You know class gets out at 9:15 right?"" and then I was over it. She wasn't, and that comment pushed her over; she said she had too much homework to come and asked me to drop her off at her dorm. When I pulled up, she sort of spat out the breakup words like a super fast word salad, jumped out of my car and ran inside before I could speak. 
I called a couple times then and later that night; no response. I sent her a good-bye text the next morning, saying that I still supported her decisions, and if it was because of anything I did that I was really sorry and if she needed anything just ask. She called back later that day.
She confirmed that it was the 9:15 comment that pushed her over the edge, and that she'd wanted to break up since the conversation over winter break. She'd been deliberately treating me terribly to try and get me to dump her, and she tried to rationalize the breakup method as giving me space to calm down (I think it was an impulse done in anger). 
I (calmly) told her I thought the way she'd handled things was immature and that she probably had some growing up to do. She started crying, saying we couldn't even be friends, hung up on me, and has now told all her friends I'm an asshole for saying mean things to her.

bf29rs,1555697156,WIBTA If I told my brother what happened to me at his wedding?,"WIBTA? I’m a 29 female and my older half-brother is 38. I have gone basically no contact with my older brother for the last eight years after his wedding. It’s about to become a lot more challenging to limit my contact with him, because I'm moving much closer to him for my job. 

A bit of context: I was very naïve and a virgin at the time of the wedding. I had an extremely traumatizing childhood that made physical intimacy / social norms very difficult. 

&#x200B;

I was 21 at the wedding. My brother had three friends. 

&#x200B;

Friend A: For the wedding, my parents rented a beach house for the wedding party to stay in a week before the wedding. For the first night, it was just me, my brother and his guys. 

&#x200B;

The first night he asked me to lay in bed with him after we talked for a bit. I pretended I was asleep. The next night after a lot of drinking, he grabbed my ass in the hot tub and I moved away from him. More drinking and I kissed him. The next night I heard him on the phone with his girlfriend. I didn’t know he had one until that very moment. I kept my mouth shut. 

&#x200B;

Friend B:  He was married and my older brother’s cousin. He made several grabs at my ass. 

&#x200B;

Friend C:  The afternoon of the rehearsal dinner, I went for a walk along the beach. He followed. I told him not to follow me, several times. He insisted. This was after days of fending off and dealing with Friend A and B. Eventually, I walked back to the house, him still following and now Friend A and B have come looking for us. They’re smirking.  

&#x200B;

I get back to the house and all my brother has to say to me is “There is a time and a place. Time and a place. This wasn’t the time or the place.” He blamed me in front of everyone. I hated him. 

The day of the wedding, while I was on the phone with my dad, my brother slapped me HARD across the ass. This was in front of Friends A, B and C and only them. When I lashed out at him, he pinned me down on the couch and pinched my arm so hard that I had a massive black bruise. Everyone was worried it’d ruin the pictures. 

There had been many instances of broken trust between us, but for me, I couldn’t recover from this. My family still make jokes about certain things that happened that I find very upsetting. 

In the last few years he has tried to reconnect, occasionally. He even named his daughter after me and made it a point to tell me this. It didn’t soften me. If anything, it made me pull further back because I’m still not even sure if I want that. 

If I’m pushed into a corner, then telling him what happened would be the easiest way to just end the pestering and the comments, but WIBTA if I did? It’s not like I want to clear the air to better the relationship. I just want them to leave me alone.

She was super busy with school so we agreed to put off a date until last night. 

I drove over to pick her up and cranked my system the entire way to pump me up for the date. I got to her house and sat out in the street for a second just letting the music flow. This is an exact cut and paste of the texts I got:

Her: Please tell me that isn't you?!!!?!!?!

Me: Hell ya! You like. 

Her: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Me: Serious

Her: First of all. You just woke up my sisters kid who's been sick for a week. UR and asshole.

dkuqa8,1571629331,"AITA for not telling my boyfriend off for liking ""sexist"" media?","I'm in a relationship of 4 months with my current boyfriend, and things have been going pretty well. He's a really sweet guy, but he's pretty shy and a bit of a stereotypical ""nerd"", and is really big into anime and video games and the like. This isn't an issue for me, though most of the guys I've dated weren't really into that kind of stuff, so it's a bit different for me.

Unfortunately, there's been some conflict between me and a few of my close friends, who I regularly hang out with as a group. I've brought him along the last few times we've hung out, which is something most of the group does with people they're dating, but some stuff came up when I first brought him along. He had his laptop with him (like a fair number of people do at these gatherings), and one of my friends saw his desktop background, which is a kind of sexy picture of some female characters that I think are from Marvel (I've seen it multiple times, it's nothing too racy). A day or two later, we were out elsewhere and she brought up that she noticed the background, and I just replied with something like ""oh yeah, he kind of likes stuff like that, his room has a lot of anime girl figures"".

In hindsight, I wish I had just said nothing. This just led her to go on a rant about how she thinks that stuff is sexist and gross, but things didn't end there. The topic came up again later after she apparently browsed through his social media briefly, and there's a lot of anime art and stuff from some of the more pervy anime games and shows that he likes (to clarify it's not like she dug around to find it, he follows my Twitter and uses his first name).

She keeps telling me to talk to him about watching things that are less sexist or whatever, but the thing is, I don't really care about what he watches. I already knew he was into that sort of stuff, and while I don't really get the appeal of it, it doesn't offend me, and I’m fine with him liking it. She says she's not trying to butt into our relationship, but thinks I'm ignoring how misogynistic a lot of those shows and games are (her words), and just says she doesn't want me to be with someone who sees me as an object. She says she feels like I'm ignoring how things like that are harmful to women and by being ok with him liking ""sexist"" things, I'm being ok with being treated in a sexist way (I'm paraphrasing here).

I'm not sure how to feel about all this. One one hand, it sounds like she's legitimately just concerned for me, which I appreciate, but I also don't feel it's her place to tell me what to do with my boyfriend. However, a few of my friends have taken her side as well, which makes me wonder if I'm the one who's in the wrong and just not seeing the big picture. Does she have a point, or should I just tell her to butt out again?

The school is around 14,000 a year and while I know it’s expensive, I take my education very seriously and want to continue attending because the school offers specialized classes that public schools don’t for a field I want to get into.

My mom made it very clear from the beginning that she would not be paying, because she didn’t think she could financially maintain it. This was right after a divorce, so I hoped that maybe she could sort things out and maybe help pay later on. However hasn’t helped pay at all in two years.

My dad said he would find a way to pay for my education, and he has so far. But I hate to see him stressed about money the way he is and I still don’t understand why my mom won’t pay if he can pay for it all on his own, when he’s much further into debt than she and he almost never has any free time. He hasn’t told me he can’t pay anymore directly, but he’s made it clear that it’s getting increasingly hard. 

Recently my grandmother on my mother’s side passed, and I’ve been regretting asking all summer because the wound is relatively fresh and no one has brought it up, but I wanted to know if any money would go to me, so my dad would not have to pay for my school any longer.

Tonight I tried to convince my mom again to help pay for my school even a little bit, and she refused. So I hesitantly brought up the inheritance. My mom told me that my grandma didn’t leave me any money, only to her four children - my aunts, uncle, and mom.

I wasn’t expecting this, but then again I didn’t know what to expect. I asked her if she would put some of the money she inherited toward my school, because it came from grandma. She still said no, and made it clear that I would only inherit money from her when she died.

I asked her if she went to an expensive private school when she was in high school. She said yes, and her parents paid for it completely. I thought about asking her if she felt bad that her parents sent her to an expensive private school but she wouldn’t help send me to one, but decided not to, I don’t really know why. I instead asked her if she thought my grandma would want me to be getting a good education from a private school just as she had, and she said that it didn’t matter.

d801yq,1569204111,WIBTA if I asked my Mom to stop critiqueing what I've cooked?,"Hello, 
I'm 20 and live at home as a student. I like to cook so I make my own meals. My family works weird hours, so when we are all home, I will sometimes cook dinner for us all- and other days, I will just make for me. You can look at my page and see i cook decent (not to self promo but just to show tou im not making slop).We all have different preferences and schedules, and for awhile, I tried to accommodate that, but it became too much.

So, I will make myself breakfast. At night, I'll make myself dinner. I'll usually just make myself what I like and I'll save the leftovers, first asking my mom if she'd like (she gets home after i eat) or I will text my dad and tell him where the leftovers are if there are any because he gets home very late, and likes to eat when he gets home. He is not critical and I am aware of his likes and dislikes.
I have a gauge of what he will and won't eat, so if I make myself, a chicken with lemon, I know he hates citrus and will just text him before bed so he knows to grab something before he gets home or he'll ask like ""oh is there any x left? i can make a sandwich when i get back.""

I do a lot of the shopping so I typically know more of what's in the fridge. And yes, I pay for a lot of groceries.

My mom is very picky and harsh. A lot of times, she will ask me if I'm making myself dinner, to make her something but to her liking, in a rude way. I buy myself chicken thighs to eat. I also buy breasts sometimes, however on a day where i had 8 hrs of hw, its just me and im making something spicy  ill make myself some thighs and she always has a rude comment. I'll say ""I made some chicken, theres an extra. Ik you don't like dark meat but if you want you can try."" She will go on a rant about how fatty chicken thighs are and ask why i didn't make her a seperate one- in the past I've done this, she'll come home and have eaten and will be full and it's wasteful.

Tonight I made myself eggs in purgatory and when she got home and saw the leftovers, she decided to try them. I told her she should heat them because a cold poached egg won't taste right. She decided to eat cold eggs and cold sauce and then went on about how DISGUSTING it was. I didn't make it for her. I made it for me and threw an extra egg in. She decided to insult me, but continued to eat going, ""ugh, never make this."" It was extremely weird and then she heated up poptarts to ""wash the taste out.""

av5hp3,1551220011,AITA Not wanting to date single moms even though I have a child,"I have a 3 year old with my ex.

The title pretty much says it all, I don't want to date single moms. My friends said I'm an asshole for that because I have a child, but here's my reasoning:

1) I like the freedom that comes with co parenting. I don't want to balance a second child's schedule and lose out on that freedom.

2) I would like any potential mother figures to prioritize my child and not have to worry about any favoritism (i.e. biological vs step child) or timing conflicts

3) Since mothers usually have more custody time than fathers in my experience, it is a bigger burden for me to take on her kids than for her to take on mine.

My bf and I have been together for 4 years, and for most of it, I’ve been the one to pay for everything. We don’t really get each other Christmas, anniversary, or Valentine’s Day presents. 
He recently got a job, so this year he insisted that we actually buy eachother presents for Vday. I went all out, and he kept saying he felt bad cause my present was gonna be a week late cause he was gonna get a lot of stuff for me and needed to have money for it. 
Yeah well, a month has passed. Every week he keeps saying “oh shit I’ve gotta order your present” and keeps complaining that he won’t have much money because “I’ve gotta order your present”. It’s to the point where he told me what it is. Ruined the surprise entirely. 

It’s just kinda lost the value at this point. The whole point was that it was a present he WANTS to get me for VALENTINES DAY. Vday was a month ago and he keeps acting like it’s SUCH a drag to have to get me something. 
I don’t even want it at this point. I kinda liked the surprise aspect. One of the items is a sweater and spring is already coming pretty soon so....

My feelings are just kinda hurt cause I don’t understand why he didn’t wanna get me something nice. He kept talking it up and now keeps acting like it’s a bother. I put so much thought into his gifts. I didn’t even wanna do presents this year but he insisted. Now it just feels like I put a lot of money and heart into it and wasn’t really given any thought in return.

That being said, my parents have some issues: My mother is an alcoholic. While she has been working hard to stay sober, I'm not capable of trusting her entirely. She's been drinking since I was a child so I can't help but feel she'll never actually beat it. My father, on the otherhand, is rather old and has serious memory issues. Then when my mother lapses and drinks, there is a 50/50 chance my father can't tell or denies it happened. 

With them being retired, they have flat out offered to nanny our child so I can return to work full-time. Had any of the other family made this offer, I'd have seriously considered it. With my parents tho, I don't know if I'm willing to risk my child's health even if they essentially offer a solution to all our concerns. Denying this means serious financial ramifications or changes in employment to get by.

When this came up in a discussion with my aunt, my mother flat out said that she expected to be the care provider while I worked. I didn't know how to handle it, having been completely thrown off guard, and kind of laughed it off awkwardly and talked about my moral belief of raising my child myself (also 100% true).

ay6nwj,1551921156,AITA for not correcting guest’s mispronounced words at work?,"  

Please, be lenient with how I spell out the pronunciations, I tried my best to make it sound right. Bear in mind \*correct means how words are generally pronounced utilizing non-regional diction. Example: jog (yog \*wrong) = jaw-gh \*correct. This might be a little lengthy... \[evil chuckle\]

&#x200B;

Setting the stage: I work as a Sushi Chef in the restaurant of a popular beach resort/ hotel in \*San Diego, California. Needless to say, we get a ton of visitors because our weather is pretty sweet, mostly tourists. They’re inexperienced with speaking names of places around here & Japanese terms for sushi components, I don’t judge. However, unlike when I was much more understanding, I have stopped correcting their mistakes. 

&#x200B;

Example:

Guest: Excuse me, kind sir. About how far is La Jolla (la-joe-la \*wrong) from here?

Me: Yes, La Jolla (la-hoy-yah \*correct) is about 20 minutes from here. I then proceed to give them instructions on taking the route through town (a scenic drive along the coast) and directions using the freeway (quicker but much less to see). 

Guest: Thank you so much – looks at my name embroidered on my chef coat – Ecchi, you are a gentleman and a scholar.

Me: Thank you, it was my pleasure. Enjoy the rest of your day.

&#x200B;

Now, it looks like:

Guest: Excuse me – looks at my name embroidered on my chef coat – Ecchi, could you tell me what’s in the Baja (buh-jaw \*wrong) Roll?

Me: Absolutely! In the Baja (buh-jaw \*wrong) Roll you’ll find… and I give the list of ingredients. 

Guest: Sounds great! Thank you for your time.

Me: Thank you! Enjoy your meal.

&#x200B;

I never see them again, but their server comes up and comments on how the guest said Baja (bah-ha \*correct) Roll in a funny way. Another time a guest pronounced it as Baja (badge-eh \*wrong). They were from the East Coast, so I just rolled with it. Again, I did not hear anything from the guest, but the server came up asking if I new what a Badger Roll was. The guest said that I knew what they were talking about. I explained what I did and that the guest was asking for the Baja (bah-ha \*correct) Roll. She laughed, called me a jerk and walked off. 

&#x200B;

Other words I don’t correct anymore:

Nigiri (nigh-jeer-y \*wrong or worse n@#%&r-y \*wrong) = nih-gih-ry \*correct

Sushi (suh-she \*wrong or suh-shy \*wrong) = sue-she \*correct

Unagi (you-nuh-ghee \*wrong) = oo-nah-ghee \*correct

Ahi (ehy-high \*wrong) = ah-he \*correct

Poke (poh-ck \*wrong) = poh-key \*correct

Tempura (tem-pure-ruh \*wrong) = tem-poo-rah \*correct

bjq45o,1556766212,AITA for not watching my ex's dog during a rough situation?,"Backstory : My ex and I dated for 6.5 years but broke up almost exactly a year ago. It was mutual but I didn't want to pursue a friendship because I'm not really into that. It makes me uncomfortable and I have a hard time transitioning from serious committed partner to just a friend. So we've seen each other a total of 6 or so times in the last year. It was always fine and cordial and we text each other super sporadically from time to time about random things we know the other is interested in, but I wouldn't say we are friends. About a month after we broke up, she started dating a new guy. A month after that, they got pregnant. 

Today, a mutual friend calls and tell me my ex went in to early labor (7-8 weeks early) and was out of town at the time visiting friends. So, all of a sudden, they (ex and new bf) are going to be stuck at a hospital 3 hrs away for a couple of weeks with preemies in NICU and have no one to watch their dog. My friend asks me if I would be willing to take my ex's dog to my house a few nights a week to watch him and give her a break. I refused. This wasn't a dog we had together in our relationship and, in point of fact, isn't even her dog, but her new partners. I said it made me feel awkward and I didn't feel like it was my burden to bear. But, as I love my mutual friend and we always try to help each other, I did offer to watch my mutual friends pets a few nights a week to help ease THIER burden. I figured that way, they can stay with the other dog and not have to make trips across town.

I've told a few people about this situation and got conflicting reports if whether I'm the asshole or not. On one hand, yes I could have taken the moral high road here and watched my ex's partner's dog, but on the other hand, it's not really my problem. Other people who are closer to her and remain friends with her are more appropriate people to ask, in my opinion. People have said that since we were together so long, I should be willing to do this thing for her if I ever really cared about her. I don't wish her any ill will, I hope everything works out, that her babies are healthy and do well.

I don't blame my mutual friend at all, they were just trying to figure out a difficult situation on very short notice. I just didn't feel like it was my responsibility to take on.

bt3gze,1558842078,AITA for not inviting a groomsman’s fiancée to my bachelorette party?,"My fiancé Sam and I are planning a joint bachelor and bachelorette party. How it works is that we both invite who we want (basically who we would be inviting to a traditional party) but it is a joint celebration. There will be a couple of small activities that are girls/guys only but for the most part, all of our friends will be celebrating together. 

One of Sam’s groomsmen, Alex started dating his fiancée Steph about 6 months into our engagement and just over a year later they are already living together and have recently gotten engaged. I think that we have been very accommodating of her in regards to the wedding, making sure to add her to the guest list even though we had already started planning when they got together. We have also changed our seating plan so that they can sit together for the reception. She is a nice person from what I’ve seen and the four of us have hung out a few times but I do not consider her a close friend so she is not on the list of people I chose to invite to my bachelorette party. 

Not long after the invites to the party went out, Alex asked Sam if Steph is able to come with him as it is a joint party. Sam told him that which girls were invited is my call, so they would have to ask me. The next day, Steph reached out to me, asking if she would be able to come with Alex. I told her that I was only inviting close friends so she would not be able to come. My reasoning is that this night is about friendship and I don’t want to make it a couples event. Besides, I don’t think it should be a problem for him to spend a night with just friends.

She seemed hurt by my response and said “Okay, I’m sorry for wanting to be included.” A few days later she messaged me again, apologising for her passive aggressive response and explained to me that the reason she wants to go so badly is because Alex works in a bar while she works a standard 9-5 job and as a result he hardly ever gets a weekend night off and they almost never get to go to parties together. She also said that getting a Saturday off is a big deal for him because it is their busiest night and him taking this day off as well as one for the wedding in a couple of months means he won’t be able to it again for quite a long time, so she really would appreciate the chance to spend it with him.

After hearing that, I do feel a bit bad about my decision but I still would prefer to keep it as a friends only event and I worry her being there would ruin the dynamic. I told her I would think about it and I am wondering if I am being an asshole for excluding her from the party and should just suck it up and invite her.",False,asshole,15,52,1
d8rvtg,1569352448,AITA for not telling my mom why I'm no longer going to join the military?,"Ok, basic backstory: I'm a military brat. Both sides of my family have a long history of serving, but it was never forced on any kids; it was always a choice. My oldest brother joined the military after high school, but my sister and other brother didn't. I wanted to join since I was little, and I wanted to be a JAG lawyer just like Mac on the show JAG (yes, I know it's not accurate, but I was 3).

However, going into my second year of law school, I found out I had a medical issue that automatically disqualifies me from serving in any capacity. I took it pretty hard, as my dream of more than 20 years was gone. I only told a few very close friends and began to reorient my goals to hopefully join the Office of General Counsel, which doesn't have as strict of health standards.

Now the part where I may be an asshole: I live away from home and haven't told my family. I'm still trying to handle it myself, and I'm not a very open person. It took me three months before I could tell my best friend. On a visit home, I was in the car with my mom (who was never very fond of me joining the military in the first place since she's old school and doesn't really think women should be in most positions). She made reference to me joining JAG in a few years, and I brushed it off by saying I'd probably just do OGC and focus on environmental law, which most JAG offices don't really do (I do genuinely enjoy environmental law, and will probably do exactly this, so it's not a lie). My mom basically just said ""oh"".

I was talking to my friend about it later, and she said that my mom deserves to know why, but I don't really agree since she never supported me in that dream in the past. It's not an issue that will cost my parents money, and I have it under control (except emotionally, but I'm seeing a counselor for that), so I don't think my parents have a need to know. My friend will support me either way, but what she said made me doubt my beliefs on my parents' right to know.

She already spent 90% of her time at my place anyway so we thought it would be a good idea to find a new apartment to make it our own. 

We agreed that because she made less than me, we’d split the cost based on percentage of income. My cost would be $1000, hers $200. 

Well, two weeks after actually moving in together we broke up (*surprise*). It’s been mutual, due to unsolved differences.

I brought up the fact that since we had broken up but were still living together, since she didn’t want to move out, it would be fair for us to each pay 50% of the rent for the time being. 

I feel like I’m no longer obliged to support her, and she feels like I’m using money to “make her small.”

Both of our names are on the contract, but the landlord doesn’t care how she gets the money. I feel like I’ve been taken advantage of, because I’ll be the one forced to continue paying since she hasn’t agreed to 50/50.

While we did agree on the 1000/200 split while together, AITA for trying to make it 50/50 after we broke up?  All of her friends are calling me every name under the sun.

Some background info: we live in a big city and only have a one bedroom, so to make matters even more awkward, we still share the same bed. We both have the same amount of strange space, fridge space, etc. 

She’s even gone as far as saying even if it breaks her, she will find a way to take over the full amount of rent (1200) and have me kicked out. According to her, there’s no reason for her to have me around if she doesn’t get any benefit.

I’ve always known she cares a lot about expensive clothes and shoes and bags, but I reached my breaking point when her first rent payment of 200 was two weeks late because she decided to buy a new pair of luxury shoes instead. 

After that, she accused me of trying to control her money and I accused her of not caring about her responsibilities, so we finally called it quits.",1563965411.0,not the asshole,3608,818,0

In the past, this guy has exhibited dominating behaviour towards me and other women, has reached up under one woman's shirt and grabbed her boob, has slapped another woman on the butt and pretended it wasn't him...

The dominating behaviour consists of continuing to follow me around at a music festival, standing *right* next to me without saying anything (as though he is passive aggressively trying to get my attention), texting me about events that I would obviously have known about through other friends.

It looks like I'll have to share a room with another female student, which is fine, but my mother warned me that it might be better to keep my sexuality a secret because my roommate might be uncomfortable with it.

I was upset with this suggestion, since I was planning on being out and proud and joining the college's LGBTQ+ society, but I also get where my mom is coming from. While my country has become increasingly liberal in the past few years, certain parts of it are still quite conservative. I dealt with homophobic bullying in highschool, so my mom is probably just trying to protect me.

The three of them are close and get along very well.

My husband comes from a well-off family, and a few months ago when his father died, he left trust funds amounting to, let’s say, $100K for each of his biological grandchildren (including Jeff and Jed) and $20K for Anna that they can access when they turn 30.

To make it clear, my husband is Anna’s father in every way except on paper. He loves her and has never treated her differently than our sons. However, he is concerned that Jeff and Jed might see this as us favoring Anna. I was planning to talk to our children about it so they would know, but my husband said that it didn’t matter if we told them tomorrow or if they find out when they’re 30, the point was that we still did not treat them equally. He said that his father’s relationship with his grandchildren is his own, and our relationship with our children is our own. He thinks we should not try to ‘make up’ for his father’s decision to leave a smaller inheritance to Anna at the cost of possibly making our sons feel that we favor their sister.

84z9xy,1521238164,WIBTA for taking my neighbors’ cats to the pound?,"Myself, my wife and my son have been in a rental home for almost two years. My wife and I are in our mid 30’s, our son is 11. We love living here, and have an option to buy after two years using a portion of paid rent as partial down payment. We are seriously considering it, as the property is not short on amenities and perfectly fits our lifestyle. 

The only issue is the cats and their owners next door. It should be noted in the county I live in, NO DOMESTIC ANIMAL is permitted off-leash. 

The couple next door allow their two cats to run freely throughout the neighborhood, and consequently they are frequently on my property. These cats urinate on our vehicles, causing irreparable damage to the paint, and they also urinate on our porch and the shrubs that are close to it. The ammonia from the cat piss has literally killed my bushes-
actually scorched would be a better term; they are bleached white. Not to mention the awful smell of sun-baked cat piss that greets us whenever we walk into our home. We planted an herb garden full of mint, thyme, rosemary, and basil which we cannot eat because they’ve pissed on that as well. They leave dead rats on our porch and antagonize our dog and cat. My cat stays inside but gets stressed out at their presence, and my dog, a somewhat high-strung pit bull, is absolutely not cool with them hanging out on his front porch. The things listed above happen with 24-hour regularity. 

About 7 weeks ago, I invited my neighbors over to my property to personally inspect the damage their animals are causing. In no uncertain terms and with photographic evidence, I politely insisted they rectify the matter. As gesture of good/neighborly faith, I told them to take 4 weeks and figure out what is best for them regarding keeping their animals on their property. They said they would take care of it. 

4 weeks passed and they did nothing, and the behavior from the animals obviously continued. I called animal control multiple times, but given their response time here is absurd (hours) and the fact cats are generally mobile creatures, the cats were always gone by the time animal control showed up. The home owner is out of state and has cleared me to deal with the issue as I see fit. 

I am sick of it. I feel I have given these people more than enough time to fix the problem, and I’m personally offended by their obvious notion I’ll just suck it up and deal with it. 

So my plan is this: since these cats are pretty entitled creatures, if you wave a treat at them they’ll come running. Not difficult in the slightest to get them into a cat carrier. Take them to animal control, check them in, give all the information I have on them, and leave a note on the neighbors’ door, reading something along the lines of “As a result of your repeated refusal to control your animal(s), I have turned it/them over to animal control. You may contact animal control to coordinate recovering the animal(s). Any further visitation on my property from these animals will result in them being immediately returned to animal control.” 

It will be relatively easy for them to get the animal back, but it will be expensive. They will have to pay citations, as well as quarantine and boarding fees. It may well come out to around $700 per animal. 

I don’t want war with my neighbors, but I’m not going to be pushed around either. They’ll most certainly interpret it as the former, and at this point, I feel that’s their problem. I’ve played ball and allowed more than enough time for the to fix the problem.

He then mentioned a list of qualities that a girl he has a crush on says she wants in a guy- funny, sweet, caring, etc. I told him that when trying to get a girl to like you, pay much more attention to how they act than what they say (if anyone was wondering, I'd say the exact same thing if my sibling was a girl and asking me advice about guys). This is because a lot of people, especially during their teenage years, have no idea what they want or what type of people they're attracted to. Sometimes people take the time to reflect/introspect and do truly know what they want, but most in my experience don't. That leads to people saying stuff that usually ends up being widely inaccurate. Therefore, it's their actions- who they're attracted to/date, who they dislike/aren't attracted to, the way they act around you, etc that you have to watch to get a good picture of them. There are girls who say they like good guys but actually are attracted to rebels, and vice versa. There are girls that say they don't like you, but secretly do. So on and so forth.

I think this is reasonable, un-sexist advice. But Jack blabbed about it to our parents, and they're pissed because they think it's assholish and sexist. I don't think it is, because as I've already said, I would repeat the exact same advice were the genders switched.",False,asshole,195,205,1
d09lq1,1567731683,AITA For telling my mom that asking me to call my dad while I was taking a shower is unfair?,"AITA? My mom rushed into the bathroom while I was taking a shower without knocking.  I had spent 10 minutes in there when she told me that she wanted me to call my dad ""right then"". She said he kept calling her so that he could call me. She threatened to take my phone away and so I did what she asked and got out (while I was soaking wet). I was on the phone with my dad for about 20 minutes before I hung up. I went to my mom and told her that that was uncalled for. She got mad at me and told me that she's the mom and she should be able to barge into whatever I'm doing and ask something of me. To which I replied that she could have told my dad that I was in the shower and waited. She ended up taking my phone away, and to be fair, I was sprouting an attitude then but my opinion hasn't changed. 

Here's some background information: My dad has been trying to call me for a maybe 4-5 days? The reasons I have not been able to call him back were because I was on a weekend camping trip without any service and because my phone has not been working. Every time I try to call someone a text shows up saying that I can only take emergency calls, but when someone calls me it works. I had tried telling him the night before that I couldn't call him and that he had to call me but, he didn't respond.

dpotha,1572534349,WIBTA if I requested a refund for a bad Uber experience?,"So last night, my team was playing game 7 of the World Series. I obviously wanted to go out to celebrate if they won or to drink the loss away with some friends. I live in the suburbs of my city and it’s about a 30 minute drive home so I decided to call an Uber.

When my Uber arrives, I open the door and I’m hit with a pungent smell of what I assume was vomit and curry. The driver was an older man and I felt bad so I didn’t say anything but with the heat on it was horrible. When he looked at where I was going he says “Oh wow, that’s a far drive. Are you sure you want to go there?” WTF. I replied “haha sorry! I know it’s a drive but I wanted to watch the game”. Again, I know I live in the suburbs but I’ve never had an issue with Uber’s not wanting to drive that far. He grunts in reply and asks me the best way to get there. I replied that his GPS was showing the best way and it required tolls. He suggested two different routes that don’t require tolls but would easily add 20-25 minutes. I replied I didn’t mind pay the surcharge on the tolls since it was the fastest route. Even if we hadn’t taken the tolls, I would pay the same price with mileage.

Before we even get out of my neighborhood, he attempts to make 2 wrong turns. I politely offered directions to which he grunted to. On the way out of my neighborhood, there are a set of curves that are pretty dangerous if you take them too fast. While they aren’t lit, there are a ton of signs warning you to slow down. He took the first turn extremely fast, then slammed on his brakes before the second turn almost causing the car behind us to hit us. Again, I tried to be understanding because the curves are tricky. When we get to the stoplight, he takes his glasses off and strains to look at the street sign, then puts them back on to look at the GPS. Right before we get to the toll road, he informs me he can’t really see at night and he probably shouldn’t drive on the highway.

Literally WTF. I was so anxious the rest of the ride. Don’t drivers see the route before they pick you up? Also, if you can’t drive at night, why tf are you an Uber driver?? WIBTA if I reported this to Uber? I feel bad because obviously this is a source of income for him and his driver rating is 4.9 so other people thought he was good.

cjremx,1564491495,AITA for assuming my friends from two seperate Native American tribes would have a lot in common and trying to set them up on a date ?,"I am from the east coast on an exchange program from my private university to a large public one in Arizona. I have made friends with lots of different groups through classes but none of my friend groups intermingle that much.

I am friends with a girl named Katie who is from a small tribe way in northern New Mexico (Katie is also half white and may be the most physicallly beautiful girl I've ever met, I'm attracted to her and I've never been a lesbian before) I'm also a freind with a guy names Notah who is from a huge tribe in Arizona. They are both such cool people but they had never met so I asked each of them if I could set them up on a date because I assumed they had a lot in common.

Well Katie said that while she's trying to be open minded, her parents would absolutely kill her if she dated someone from Notah's tribe. Notah was even more direct and said that I was actually trying to get him beat up or worse because there is so much hatred for his tribe among the pueblos in New Mexico and Arizona that goes back 1000 years. I said we live in 2019 and he's allowed to do and do go wherever he wants. He says basically yeah as a tourist but not rucking someone's daughter or sister. Notah said I was being an asshole and approaching racist to assume all native Americans would have things in common.

Most of my more traditional white friend's and the ones from here said I really  overstepped and if Katie and Notah were meant to meet they'd meet, my friends from Europe and the east coast said I did nothing wrong and basically it's ok to move people past prejudices.

dma1o0,1571884322,AITA for being pissed my mom wont let me and my boyfriend sleep in the same room?,"I (19f) have been dating my boyfriend (23m) for about a year and a half.

We are LDR, but he has visited me previously and my family does like him and know him. My mom actually really does like him, and was excited to have him stay at our house for his next visit. 

However, she made one rule: He sleeps in the basement and I will go upstairs to sleep in my room when it’s time for bed. Her reasoning is she doesn’t want us doing anything “inappropriate” and “knows what we will do” and that it’s “disrespectful” and “disgusting” to do while they’re in the same house. 

I was really annoyed by this because I never see him, and this visit is only 4 days. I don’t want to be apart an entire night, and do the routine of calling him on my phone and facetiming to sleep like I do when he is away, but now having to while he is IN MY BASEMENT. 
It isn’t even just about sex, I just want to be next to him at night. We are about 1000 miles apart. I want to use all the time we have together.

So we recently got a hotel for his visit since that rule isn’t realistic. I will respect her house rules, and go somewhere else. She is pissed about it and was pretty excited for him to stay at the house and really likes having him around. She is saying “I just dont understand because you wanted to save money for your visit!” Which we did, but being apart every night isn’t super realistic for us so it was worth spending the money.

I’m sort of pissed about it though, because it just doesn’t seem super reasonable or logical at all. Also I’m a little annoyed I have to buy a hotel over this, but it is worth it to me anyway. 
And I’m also pissed she’s being annoying about us getting one when there wasn’t much of an option here. She did give us the okay originally and said we can do that instead. But after thinking about it, and deciding the rule wasn’t doable, we actually did end up getting a hotel and she’s annoyed. 

She’s also annoyed because I have a brother who’s a decade younger than me (who’s 9) and she says “you guys cant just ignore him and not include him and hang out with him! Your brother likes your boyfriend too” (he does in like an older brother way I guess) and always wants us to plan stuff with him and hang out with him at the house, and is angry we won’t include him in things and is angry he wont be at the house so we can’t include him in as much now. But like, it’s my boyfriend! So I don’t even know what that is about?! 

Also I REPEAT: I did end up getting a hotel because I WILL respect her rules, I however do find them annoying, but she is pissed we did even though she was fine with it till we actually did. Which also sort of pisses me off.

Also another detail: We DID agree to not do a hotel the entire time, and we will stay at my house for the first night and be okay with her rules, then go to a hotel the rest of his stay. Because she was excited about him staying. But after that we have a hotel because I don’t think its super realistic to separate every night his entire visit and spend a whole night away from him.

I am a new grad level software developer for 3 months. There is this guy sitting next to me is in the company for 2+ years and at his mid 30s, while I am 25. He is the most experienced in our team after the manager. We are working in agile methodology, so basically we divide the job into parts and each teammate takes a task, completes and moves on. People generally take task related to his/her previous part on the project. Because they have developed and are familiar with that parts. 

I have completed tasks related to me and was eager to get a new one. I took a task related with his part. He could have done it before me but I did not mind. At that point he had to inform me about the task not because he is experienced but I was going to modify his code. He explained me what to do briefly. And I worked 2 hours on and completed what exactly what he said. 

Here is what happened. The next day in the meeting, our manager told that the task was done wrong. So basically he's solution to that simple problem was wrong. I told that we talked with him and thought our solution was correct, and told that we will discuss this with him. After the meeting, he looked unwilling to talk though I asked him would you do the task? Not to enforce him, but the solution our manager wanted was on the page he is currently working on, so my modification might make his task problematic.

I was expecting yes or 'You can continue doing it, I will help with the info you will need' and a brief sorry maybe. Instead he started blaming me for bringing his name in the meeting and how irresponsible am I to throw away my task on him and so. It was unexpected and I vocalized my thought 'that was your fault'. Then he continued how disrespectful I am and so. There was no yelling but a loud speaking. 

During the day the Scrum Master (who is knowledgeable on the agile methodology) came to my desk to ask some question. When she was leaving he brought up the situation with me without mentioning my name, he told that is it cool to throw away our tasks to others. As he did not mention the whole context, I got involved and told the whole story. While she was tying to chill the waters, he blamed her for not knowing how disrespectful I am.

I also still have school books and services to pay for. Plus my dues. So i didnt give the 10 dollars. However, i would have given something if it was 5 or under because i have spare cash for emergencies or something. Even though i dont like digging into my savings.

Fast forward to now. She is currently jobless and extending her stay. I don't mind but she recently got into an argument with her BF (34M) which I'm not even gonna add here cause its not related. But they come into an agreement that since I'm the one staying at her place right now I'll be middleman to pass their things.

Her BF ask me to pass her (paid) electricity bills and dead bro phone back, so I agree. But when I met up with him, I got bombarded with multiple phone calls from her asking to pass to BF because BF is not picking his phone up. They argue, and people were looking. I was made to feel as if I'm a homewrecker or something.  She even threaten to come there and make a scene.

We are of middle eastern culture so we are brought up to always help, support and endure the family and their mistakes.

So in his will, my dad left the family some money to get by. Its enough to feed us and pay all the bills for little over a years time if we all contribute equally to the circumstances (My brother, my mother and my sister and me got nearly equal share, with my mom having the most obviously, which is, as it should be).

So we are about a little over a months in on my dad passing away and we all still visibly struggle with emotions and dealing with all the stuff, because my mom was never working (middle eastern culture, as I said) and she was more of a stay at home mom for most of her life, but did a wonderful job in raising us, I couldnt be more proud of the education and love we received growing up, which is not a given in this culture.

So naturally we are about to sell our big appartment to downsize because of low income (I recently graduated and now making acceptable amount of money, my brother is 22, jobless and isnt really the type of person searching for a job, my sister is underage and still living with my mom.)

So as the oldest son, the duty of providing for my family fell onto me, which I gladly will take responsibility of, because thats what my father would have wanted.

&#x200B;

The Problem is, that my brother wants to take his share and not contribute to the situation.

So we had a huge argument and I told him, that I fully understand, that its fathers will and his share and he can do whatever he wants with it, but it would be nice, if he contributed to the bills and stuff,  which will cost us a lot.

The funeral was very expensive on its own, so some of the share has already been burned up.

He refused to contribute, because he says he got no job and needs the money.

The problem is, that I know, that he takes this as a free pass to not work for a couple month and feed him off of his share and only after its depleted, he would look for a job again.

But I would have expected, that he knows, how hard this is on the entire family and contribute even just a tiny bit.

So I snapped at him and told him to never speak to me again and get lost.

&#x200B;

After things cooled down the past days, I tried to contact him to make up with him, but he didnt call back.

My mom and sister told me I was too hard on him, but I personally disagreed up until now. Hence this post, if I ATA.

I know that it is hard on him too. I may have done him wrong and its definetly his choice to decide, what he does with the money.

But my father did raise us to always look out for each other, which hurts to see, that he currently is not.

But then again, he may have real problems, we do not have time for right now, which I could be neglecting and thus he may feel ignored. But we got bigger fish to fry right now in my opinion.

I moved out 21 (am 25 currently) and graduated this year and found a job immediately and have been full time employed for the last 2 months.

Regarding the question of how much I would like him to contribute, we did not have a fixed number yet. It was more like the first thing he said, he wouldn´t do, so we did not come down to the part of actually calculating, how much it exactly was. Of course we already payed for the funeral and I calculated the next 12 month of groceries, rent, canceling fee of current apartment, down payment of next and so on. This I did AFTER we had the fight, because it was pretty much the first thing he said after he got to see the money from my fathers will, so we immediately had an argument.

I yelled at her to go to her room but she says no another reason I go in there is because I hate our room my sisters dosen't keep it clean like I try to. So she brought her mess into the room.

Me and two others didn't want to drive for such a long time (12 hours +) and looked for plane tickets. We found a cheap flight and told the others. They didn't want to fly and we came to the conclusion to split up on the way there. The others offered to take our luggage in the car so we could save the cost of it if we brought it on the flight. We did not specifically talk about a possible payment for the transported luggage.  


Now we all arrived and the people who took the car want to share all payments made for the car trip (e. g. patrol, tolls). It wasn't discussed directly they wrote it on our 'list of owed money'.  


We're now nearing the end of our vacation and the three of us who flew are pretty upset with this since we owe them more than the cost we would have had if we brought it on the plane (but we didn't talk with the others yet).

clwq95,1564927930,AITA for not paying for my sister's expensive shoes?,"This is a throwaway for privacy and I'm on mobile so sorry if I mess up. This happened awhile ago but I still feel bad. 


So I (f 40) recently adopted a dog. I got her as a rescue when she was 4 months old. She'd had very little training and in the first couple of weeks after I brought her home she ate about 10 pairs of shoes. I put them up high, she'd jump to get them down, I put them in a cupboard, she'd figure out how to open the door. She was irresistibly attracted to shoes. So I bought a locking wall mounted shoe cabinet. 


I instilled in husband and the kids, no shoes left out. She will find them. Always lock away the shoes. Kids would have friends over, first thing was to lock away all shoes. 


All was well for 2 weeks after getting the cabinet, no more casualties and late night runs to buy new school shoes. This was until my sister (45f) arrived for a visit. She's always liked the nicer things in life and rubbing them in my (much less well off) face. 


So she walks through the front door. I let her know beforehand about the dog's shoe fetish. I told her at the front door, please please put your shoes away, that's the only way they'll be safe. 


So an hour later, sister has been telling me about these amazing $500 shoes she got on sale, like half price but still 250 which is for me personally a huge amount of money for shoes. She'd actually brought these with her, I'll go get them to show you! 30 seconds after she steps out, a scream. The dog had one of her expensive shoes, and there was no saving it.


I wrung my hands, how on earth had she gotten into the shoe cabinet? It had been faultless! Turns out sister had just shoved her shoes under the cabinet, perfect puppy height and easily reachable. I obviously apologised profusely, she said she was in shock and it was left at that. 


The next morning she comes to me and asks me to pay for a replacement. Now usually I'd absolutely agree my dog did the damage. But $250 Is a huge amount for me, I could have paid but it didn't seem fair as I warned her multiple times that the dog chews shoes and they had to be in the cabinet. Even reminding her as she took off her shoes. So reddit, AITA  for not paying?",False,not the asshole,4,29,0
dofkql,1572297511,AITA for letting my ex think I’m moving on when we’re trying to be nice to each other?,"I’m on mobile, FYI. Also my first time posting!

After three years, this year being especially rough, my ex broke up with me a few weeks ago. We’ve since checked in a few times here and there, no serious conversations just “have a nice day” and the like. We care about each other, and it wasn’t a malicious breakup or anything.

Today I was hanging out with a friend of mine, and when I responded to a snap from my ex he didn’t recognize the apartment. He started asking disguised questions and basically wanted to know where I was and who I was with.

I was purposefully vague and didn’t tell him I was just hanging with a friend. I think I did it because the break up hurt, and didn’t think it was fair for him to ask those kinds of questions. Later, I saw tweets that he was upset that I was “moving on so quickly.” My friend says it’s not my problem, but I feel like maybe I was wrong for being vague and should’ve just told them the truth, especially when we’re trying to be courteous to each other.

We've mostly been with our mom ever since, we go to our dads about 1 day a week. And he's learned my mom's flaws in parents (ex: doing something to her if she won't get him something.)

There's this freshman kid who we will call Jay and he bothers me a lot. The first time we met, he was hitting on me in a school cafe. I told him that I had a boyfriend, but he kept going (and ended up launching into a rant about how he loves women of all sizes and his family thinks he has a fat fetish.) It made me extremely uncomfortable.

Since then, I learned he has high functioning autism, and, having a sister who has high functioning autism, I tried to be more patient about him. But he's kind of an ass and he's crossed a few lines with me that autism can't excuse. He makes comments about how he likes me and finds me attractive that make me uncomfortable. He corners me, physically, into conversations I don't want. And he keeps trying to hug me or touch me, even after I say ""Please do not touch me. I do not like being touched."" 

I try to be nice while still maintaining boundaries, but he continues to cross them and I am really bad at being mean...so I just started to avoid it all together. I stare at my phone or walk away when I see this kid coming, praying he doesn't come over and try to hug me or jump into a conversation. Today he cornered me again and I ended up texting a friend to distract him while I got up and left, then had to sneak back behind him to grab my bag.

I HATE this. This is middle school bullshit and it makes me feel immature and shitty. But every time he sees me he makes me uncomfortable either by touching me or via the conversation topic and directly telling him I'm not comfortable with these things doesn't seem to make it stop.

c5bt1p,1561482938,WIBTA: Friend wants to surprise boyfriend with a dog,"For clarification, I'd just like to start off by saying I love all animals, especially dogs. I would have my own if I had the time. I also love my friends, the boyfriend came on later but he always seemed like a cool cat and I even helped him a bit get with my friend.

Anyways, my friend hits me up asking if I'd be willing to drive with her to pick up a dog to gift the boyfriend for his 21st birthday. I am rather experienced with long drives so I am done nonetheless. However, she wants to buy a dog to surprise the boyfriend with the dog. They had talked about it, just about what dogs he liked, and he seemed to like labs and german shepherds.

However, I think this is a terrible idea. Both her and her boyfriend are both in school. Her boyfriend is in business school and has internships, while my friend is also in school and works to support herself pretty long hours. She currently has a dog, a french bulldog, but it is perhaps one of the worst-behaved dogs I have ever met in my life. He bites hands whenever anyone reaches on the ground, and you can't even pet him for too long before he starts to snarl. This is because when she first got the dog, her and her sister [who works full time] were just as busy as they are today. That dog does not heel, and the only tidbits of training he really has is peeing somewhat near the peepad when he is home for most of the day and the fact that he can sit and give a high five. They refused to train him any harder because they read somewhere that negative reinforcement with frenchies will get them depressed, but I have another friend with a frenchie that is a very good boy through training.

Now if they get a lab, or even a german shepherd, I know those dogs are highly intelligent, and need constant supervision and training at a young age. I am just worried that the new puppy would suffer the same fate as their french bulldog. My friend says that she would help out with the dog, but it seems like her options to do so remain quite limited. WIBTA if I tell her this is a bad idea?

bvq8ta,1559426938,AITA for trying to get my sister kicked out?,"My house consists of my Mom, my disabled sister, me (20) and my sister (24) with her 1 year old son. I'm the only one working right now, and I'm trying to save up to move out with my fiancee, but after my base rent of 200 a month plus all the extra I  give to help cover bills, I basically have a coin jar of savings. My  fiancee can't move in with us because we have dogs and she has 2 cats,  but my goal is to live with her by any means necessary.

On  to my sister. She would sneak her baby daddy (abusive asshole) into the house after Mom told him he wasn't welcome, up until the baby was 6 months old. Hasn't paid rent since she last worked,  when she was 3 months pregnant. Doesn't do chores, half the time she won't even clean up after her own kid.

Forward to today. I went to talk to my Mom to find her in tears. Her bank card was missing. Then she goes on to her account to find 60$ missing, from a gas station, drug store, and a liquor store. My sister stole the bank card and lied when asked about it. Since this is the dad's weekend, she's spending the weekend over at a guy's house with the card. Hasn't answered Mom's calls since she initially asked about it.

Mom  is heartbroken, but I am furious. My Mom's the type of woman that would  give her last penny to someone who needs it more than her, and to see  this happen to her after everything she's done for my sister, living  rent free to buying her son new clothes just yesterday, it sickens me. 60$ may not sound like much to some, but to this family it's a massive blow.

If she reports it as stolen, the  bank will review cameras and my sister will get  prosecuted. This would leave custody of  her son with her father, which we don't want. I again told her to  kick my sister out, and she once again didn't want to do that to her  grandson.

So, I gave her an offer. My fiancee is wonderful with kids, and the dogs never go in the basement, making it the perfect place for us to keep the cats. I told  her if she sued for custody of my nephew and kicked my sister out, I would give  her my entire savings as well as the rest of my paycheck each month so  she can truly catch up on bills. My fiancee would also pledge her  disability each month to help, watch the kid, and do chores.

My  goal here isn't to take my sisters kid. I don't want to do that, I know  she loves her son, but she should love her son enough not to fuck over  the woman that puts a roof over his head and food in his stomach. She  could take her son at any point she felt ready to take care of him,  whether staying with a friend, a boyfriend, or getting a job and her  shit together.

There will be approximately 17 of us staying in this house over 3-4 days, and she said it sleeps 18 total but there are only 3 bedrooms? It is unclear where everyone will sleep.

My mom was upfront about the sleeping arrangement rules... once I asked. She stated her & her husband were excited to meet/get to know my boyfriend but that unless we got married and didn't tell them, we have to sleep separately. I was expecting some sort of scriptural explanation or something but all she sent (this is all by text) was ""Based on God's moral standards, no sex before marriage."" I let her know that we would consider having sex during this time, under the same roof as family, to be both gross and rude but I didn't receive a reply. Considering all of the people coming/going I suggested wouldn't it be easier for us to stay in the same bed, to consolidate space, but she replied ""It would be easier, but you're not married, so no it wouldn't be easier.""

I told my mom that I'm fully prepared to respect their rules because I know it's their house, their rules. I don't want to push back too much but I can't help but feel.. unaccepted?

I understand and appreciate the sentiment and am glad that she’s thinking of us and misses us... however here are some facts that has made this a nightmare situation for me:

We live in a small one bedroom apartment. We’re newly weds who have combined both of our respective stuff and are still trying to get rid of excess crap cuz we have no where to put it. We both have very busy schedules (law school) and thus have barely anytime to clean and put stuff away as it is.

Meanwhile, my mom is sending things all the time (weekly at its height, with small stuff in here and thete); this includes many things that we definitely have no room for, and/or already have or don’t need that we suddenly have to find room for. (3 different garlic peelers?! Multiple Crockpots? Dont get me started on random shirts). This stuff mostly ends up taking up space on the couch or ground because there literally are no drawers or places to put them. I have to break apart cardboard boxes all the time. I even have bags of clothes that I have to takr to Good Will every couple months. (Note: We’ve given some stuff to friends. We would sell them on craigslist but we dont have spare time to do this all the time)

I’ve brought this up several times with my Mom, both over phone and person. I’ve tried in a casual/polite way and another in a more direct way. And I always try to explain to her about her situation and how her gifts (although thoughtful) are actually causing us some stress. She either brushes it off as me being crazy or says she understands but then clearly doesn’t.

For example, we came to a mutual agreement that if she saw something nice and wanted to send us something she would send us a link or ask if we could use one. A week later, via text, “Oops, finger slipped on Amazon, sent u guys this _____ enjoy :)”

What annoys me is how this os a genuine thing affecting us, making me live a cluttered and shithole apartment, but since shes being nice and sending gifts it feels like I’m an asshole for telling her to stop. (People look at me like im ungrateful when I tell them my problem)

Since our 2nd son (s2) was born she has been a complete dick. He died in December (unexpectedly at 18m) she has been unsupportive and plain selfish, to the point where she asked us to move the funeral as it might not have been convenient for her family. 

When s2 was born he had some major health problems. She said she would move closer to help (a nurse). She sold her house bought a new one, packed her stuff up then pulled out a week before they were due to move, as her partner was finding it stressful. 

She said in Nov that they weren't prepared to travel and see us over Xmas (an hour drive) this didn't change after s2 died. 

My husbands birthday was between the death and funeral (18days). She had no intension of coming to see us before the funeral and I had to ask her to visit her son on his bday. 

We had some teddy bears made out of s2 clothes for family members (1 for my parents, 2 sisters, FIL and us) they weren't cheap. They were all made out of his clothes people had given him. She didn't get one of the originals, one reason was she never gave him one peice of clothing his entire life. I thought at the time that we could have one made for her, and his sister at a later date. She has also now offered to pay for hers. 

She has always been distant from our children. Never fed them, changed a nappy, taken them out anywhere on their own. We have only 1 picture of her with s2, none of her partner.

I just feel like she dosent deserve one, she never bought him anything and I can count on my hands how many times she saw him. I'm aware my anger at her may be clouding my judgement. We are still grieving and in therapy. 

My husband is annoyed with her and said she has been ""shower of shit"". Yet she has total control over his 42yo sister (who has mental health problems) so we can't cut her out of our lives. 

WIBTA if I said she couldn't have a memory bear, even though she has asked for one and offered to pay for it.

First Post for me, please be gentle 😂

Update following some questions:

- He went up a size in clothes in Nov. We had a large sort out (including s1 clothes) and gave a lot to charity / people in need about this time. We didn't keep much as we thought we were done having kids. SIL won't be having children, my sister has three boys and is definitely done, other sister only wanted disney stuff kept. We had enough for our bear anyway. All others were still made out of things people had given him. She had never given him any clothes. So anything would need to come from stuff currently hanging in his wardrobe. 

- We had slate hearts made with his handprints (taken at the funeral home) on with DoB and DoD on. Every family member had one including SIL and MIL. So she has had some memorial things from us. 

- SIL and MIL asked for photos, we had loads printed out and set over. MIL kept all and had to get more done for SIL.

- She plays the doting Grandmother on FB, yet its all for show. Im inclined to think she wants a bear for the sympathy vote other than a genuine memorial.",1564332611.0,not the asshole,12,54,0
d07cxm,1567719967,AITA for snapping at my dad for refusing to take care of the dog he got?,"My father recently got a puppy a month ago, about 5 months old for my oldest daughter. He had mentioned to us before he wanted to get her a pet dog because according to him ""it would calm her down ""every kid needs a dog"" ""its the best thing for her"" ""she'll love me for this!"" blah blah... I could go on and on about his convincing speech. I should also mention that he lives with us at the moment and yes he helps with bills. I asked him ""I'm on board if you help watch the puppy and pitch in, it's basically your dog after all.."" He swore up and down he'd help out, by taking it on walks etc. So fast forward, he gets her a cute female cockapoo. My daughter is overjoyed, cuddles and kisses the damn thing constantly. Sometimes we have to pry the dog off her so she can eat and go to sleep. Both my husband and myself got all the essentials out of our own pockets. Dog crate, food, puppy pads, shampoo, treats, brush, lysol and paper towels to clean up the messes...omg the messes..ugh...
Everything good right? Wrong...because lets just say this entire month my father showed his true colors. He refuses to take her out because ""ugh i'm too old for this shit, she's too hyper for me to walk her..."" Me and my husband are the ONLY ones who take her on walks and clean up her poop and pee when she goes indoors. It mostly falls on me because i stay at home while my husband works. I'm the one who feeds her, cleans when she knocks down our trash can. The one who has to get her away from things she tries to eat...the one who needs to be with her at all times because he got a puppy with separation anxiety... and at night she jumps on our bed because if we leave her out in her crate she barks and cries like crazy and no one can sleep. My father sleeps like a rock all night meanwhile i get up at 2 am every night with an alarm to allow the puppy to pee and poo so it doesnt go on our bed.

diovs6,1571230301,AITA for being annoyed at my sister for planning my Hens,"
I honestly don’t know what my expectations should be around bridesmaids / pre wedding events etc.

I love my partner and the idea of spending our lives together, but I am so self conscious of the idea of being a bride at a wedding. I really struggle with being  the focus of attention and try to hide and tend to freeze up and I let things go which I get disappointed about later. I really don’t want this to happen for  our wedding.

So, wedding date is set and is 14 months away. I have asked my bridesmaids. I haven’t picked one as a maid of honour- never really got the whole thing. 

My sister has gone ahead and started planning my hens night. She invited people into a chat group and planned a whole surprise weekend away. Which sounds lovely except:

- we haven’t invited anyone to the wedding yet
- she never asked me what I wanted - we never even remotely talked about it
- she invited my work supervisor, MIL and other people I don’t want at my Hens night, some of these people I don’t / didn’t plan on inviting to the wedding
- the places and locations are things I don’t like or want for a hens
- while doing this, she also has been avoiding talking to me for months.
- I’m not even sure I want a hens party

I found out because my MIL mentioned it not realising that I didn’t know about it.

When I expressed frustration to my other bridesmaid her response was “you’re gonna have to deal with that!” and my mums response was that my sister has worked hard to come up with a really great weekend plan. She made it sound like I should just be grateful for what I get.

My thought was how can it be a really fret pan if I don’t like it?

I have since  asked her to hold off planning anything until we invite people to a wedding. She said ok and then stopped replying to me.

However after she left and I actually tried the soup, it really wasn’t my taste and I struggled to enjoy it. I offered it to my husband (he refused and said it was specifically for me) so I threw it out.

My husband is extremely upset and said it was disrespectful for me to waste something MIL made for me. I deeply appreciate the gesture but I just really didn’t like the soup. I have no intention of telling MIL I hated it or anything like that or even mentioning it at all. It’s a very sweet  gesture and I love her for it.

dkftqn,1571551604,AITA for buying alcohol from a black market network?,"Let me first point out it's not me (that's a formatting issue), it's my parents who did this.

First some context. In my way life I lived on a dirt poor Indian Reservation in North Dakota. My dad got a job as a teacher there and I was born a couple years after they moved. Because of the state of hospitals there I was actually born in Bismarck, the state capital and closest city of any notable size. As a kid we had to drive up to Bismarck for doctor and dentist checkups, big shopping trips, even to see a movie in theaters. We eventually moved to Bismarck when I was in third grade.

In the town we lived there was no bars or liquor stores but my parents visited one outside the city limits near a mostly white ranching area. Alcohol was a huge issue there due to extreme alcoholism rates and drinking was still prevalent, many empty beer cans littered the sides of the road. 

Eventually Standing Rock banned alcohol on the Reservation entirely. You could still in theory import your own alcohol if it was bought off the Reservation, which my parents did at times. However Bismarck was an hour drive away and not everyone there had a car. So what happened is a black market network was set up, people would drive up to Bismarck, buy a ton of alcohol in bulk, and drive back and sell it illegally on the Reservation. What's interesting is how out in the open they were about it, they had lists of all the drinkers and white people who lived there and went door to door selling alcohol out of the back of a car. They also gave ""business cards"" with a phone number you could call and arrange to meet them in an abandoned garage somewhere turned into an impromptu liquor store. Many of the people involved weren't even Reservation residents, they were either small scale hoodlums from Bismarck looking to make an easy buck or people linked to organized crime and illegal drug distribution in Bismarck. And they brought illegal drugs to the Reservation too.

You can see this didn't work out. So in a year the Reservation reversed the ban. In the meantime my parents admitted to buying from the illicit distribution network because it was simply easier than the Bismarck commute. And they feel pretty guilty about that because of all the damage it caused and the excaberation of alcoholism problems those networks provided. They could've just sucked it up and made big buying trips in Bismarck instead of just buying there when it was convenient and they were there anyway. I told them it's not their fault: it was a stupid law.

Last night she brings it up and the wedding is today. It was already to late for me to take off work and I had to go in for my shift. She wanted me to go and I still kinda had the same feelings.

While at work we have a text argument because I didn’t want to go still. I felt like I was justified because I woke up at 5:30am, worked a 9 hour shift, had to come home and get ready, then drive 2 hours to the wedding reception (she decided just to go to the reception), and then say there for who knows how long, then a 2 hour drive back home.

One of the caveats of this condition is she can't really wear deodorant as it exacerbates the symptoms. She bathes multiple times a day but if I can be candid, it's not always enough.

We got coupons for free massages on Christmas and decided to use them the other day. Mine went pretty well, although I doubt the merit of massages as I feel the same before as I did after, but that's besides the point. My wife, when hers was done, left the parlor without saying a word and waiting in the car while I settled tips.

Apparently her masseuse said ""you probably have diabetes because of your smell"" which killed the mood for my wife. She doesn't have diabetes, it's because of her condition. I'm paraphrasing the exact comment because my wife won't repeat it, but she felt dirty and vulnerable the whole massage because of it.

I phoned the parlor today and told them my concerns and that it's not right for a masseuse to make these kind of comments.

cjkude,1564450938,AITA: Didn't want to Tip at a Restaurant,"So my wife and I are on a low carb diet (I am losing weight and she has controlled diabetes with her diet), so there isn't a ton of places we can go eat in our small town. So we go to the same restaurant fairly regularly and were served by a new gal. 

&#x200B;

I ordered Fajitas with no tortillas, beans or rice and asked if I can get a side salad instead (something we have done probably the last 7-8 times we were there), but was told no to the side salad as a substitute and that it would be $2 more. I declined and said no salad, so she went to add back on the beans and rice and went back and forth a couple of times as I tried to explain that it was no to either. (I used strange and confusing phrasing like, ""No beans, rice or salad, please."")

&#x200B;

My wife ordered a scrambled egg dish and asked their sausage was patties or links and was told patties to which she replied, ""excellent!"" She was really looking forward to the patties on the side and green chiles cooked in (we're in New Mexico, it's a thing here). 

&#x200B;

My son ordered his normal french toast with nothing but butter, specifically no powdered sugar if they serve it with that as he doesn't like the sugar. 

&#x200B;

The food took forever, I am guessing it was busier than they expected a Monday night to be given the staffing level.

&#x200B;

My wife order came and had chunks of sausage but no green chiles and no patties of sausage at all, when asked the waitress said she had them do that just in case because some people don't like chiles. My son's french toast had sugar all over it and I never did my drink or sour cream and guac for the fajitas. 

&#x200B;

It had taken so long to get the food that I was getting grumpy and didn't want to send it back and have to wait all over again. So we buttered my son's french toast so he wouldn't notice the sugar and ate what we had. 

&#x200B;

I didn't want to tip at all in this case. I had ordered the most expensive thing on this restaurants menu and felt like we had gotten pretty poor service overall. I didn't want to complain to a manager because I feel that is pretty confrontational and makes for a VERY poor experience if I am ever in that discussion (like I won't go back the experience is so unpleasant). My wife has been a waitress and said it was this gal's primary source of income and we just couldn't not tip (and she felt it was the cook's fault more likely than the server in this case). I argued back that it was the primary way of expressing happiness or discontent with your meal, it's not like I could tip her well and short the price of the meal.

do9s8f,1572273838,AITA for not going to my boyfriend's ex mother-in- law's funeral?,"My(28F) boyfriend(38M) of two years just left for his ex mother-in-law's funeral and visitation. We had been talking about it the past few days because I've been unsure if I wanted to go or not. I was leaning towards not going because, well, funerals suck. I did not know his ex mother in law. And I usually get pretty emotional at them, even if I don't know the deceased. Add in a room full of his ex wife's family and friends who probably don't want me there to begin with, I just thought it would be too much for everyone involved. 

 Whenever I brought it up to boyfriend he would just say he doesn't care if I don't go, no one else probably would care either so it's ok if I don't and he understood. But he would prefer if I was there. He also has two kids(11 & 14), who he said would want me there. Of course my heart breaks for the kids and I want to do everything I can to ease their pain. 

Which I have been trying my best, we had them at our house for the past week and I spent every day cheering them up, watching their favorite movies, cooking their favorite meals, shopping, ect. I sent their mother a long text offering my condolences(and got no reply). When mother in law got sick initially I bought her flowers twice, made crafts with the kids to give her, and sent her some homemade soup. 
 
I just figured I wouldn't be of much use considering how emotional I get, and they have their mother, father, aunts, uncle's, ect. My boyfriend would have friends there and his mother. At first I wasn't even sure if boyfriend would be that upset during the whole thing because since I've met him he's had nothing but negative things to say about the deceased up until the day she died. And I guarantee during the visitation boyfriend would be busy catching up with old friends(mostly the other couples him and ex wife used to hang out with, as a couple) . Kids would not leave their mothers side. And I would just be awkwardly stand there. Now I cannot tell the future, but they are all a fairly predicable bunch.

This morning, I asked him again when we got up if he absolutely is sure it's alright if I sit this one out, he says again that he doesn't care and it's alright.

630e7m,1491148749,AITA for asking to touch a friend two times?,"I've been chatting with someone from okcupid for a couple months now, we know each other pretty well, and have exchanged numbers and also talked on the phone quite a few times.

It started turning somewhat romantical, and I've basically started to accept polyamory as a concept for my own life because of her. She never wanted a relationship, and I stopped wanting it as well. Still, there was something.

We talked about pretty intimate stuff. Essentially we both knew pretty much knew at least the gist of each other's sex and romatical lives.

I know she has a troubled past. She had an abusive partner in the past and has nightmares because of it. She is somewhat stuck at home having to care for her mother with alzheimers (or something akin to it, I don't remember what exactly it was), whose behavior is sometimes very erratic.

We've arranged dates multiple times and she always cancelled. Sometimes because of work, sometimes she told me outright that she didn't feel comfortable with meeting because she needs a lot of alone time - and because she lives pretty far away, a date would include me staying with her for the night.

This friday, to my surprise, she told me that I could come visit because she cancelled her plans for Saturday. That night, i.e. the one between Friday and Saturday, she cancelled again - because she was scared she'd disappoint me, and that she might not be in a good mood, and might need alone time.

At that point I was a little done, because I'd gotten excited to meet her so many times and it never worked out, and it was just too frustrating to continue like that. I wanted to end this relationship with her because I cannot deal with never meeting a person I'm as interested in as in her and essentially just text chatting forever. I was a little frustrated and said some things I wasn't that proud of, at which point she wrote ""That's enough."" and turned off her phone.

The next morning, I sent her a message, wanting to say goodbye and part on better terms. As I said, I wasn't proud of the things I said that night, so I wanted to at least say some nicer words for a goodbye.

After I sent my last message, she told me I could come over now. I wasn't excited. But I thought, I'm not the kind of person to just say ""no"" now on principle, so I agreed if she'd send me the address. And she did. And she seemed excited. She told me we probably wouldn't have sex because she's on her period, and she also told me we'd have to go shopping later because she doesn't have any vegan food for dinner (I'm vegan, she's vegetarian).

So I got up, got ready, did my makeup and stuff and drove over to her, two and half hours. I arrived, we hugged, and I was really happy to finally see her. We went to her room and sat on the bed as she finished up her laundry. We chatted. I looked at her a lot, I was really excited and content to finally see her and be with her. But me looking at her irritated her. She kept asking me what's wrong.

We continued chatting for a bit. I asked her if I could lean onto her. She said no. But I was so confused by this no, and it sounded a little like it could be sarcasm. Also, she said earlier that we wouldn't be having sex because she's on her period. This indicated to me that she'd be willing to otherwise, and I thought, because of that, and because of how intimate our chatting was, touching and cuddling would be okay. I asked her if it was sarcasm, she said no. I did not touch her.

Then, she got up, storing something away in her closet, and this conversation happened:

> Her: Are you staring at me?

> Me: Yes.

> Her: Why?

> Me: Because you're pretty?

> Her: That's a shitty answer.

> Me: What else am I supposed to say?

> Her: How about ""sorry?""

> Me: Okay, sorry, I'll stop looking at you then.

She sat down next to me again.

We talked a bit more, about everyday stuff. A little later:

> Me: I'd like to touch you.

> Her: -silence-

> Me: But you don't want that.

> Her: No.

I thought about what to say for a moment.

> Me: That's completely fine.

More silence.

> Her: Do you know now why I thought this was a bad idea?

I didn't know what to say. I just kind of said something like that I'm still happy to be here and that it always takes a little while to get comfortable with someone new in person and stuff.

She then asked me if I'd mind driving back home. She said she'd really like to be alone right now.

I did not expect this. At all. I started thinking about what I could say to change something, and how I'd driven to her 2.5 hours, and how this would be pretty much over forever now. Upon her asking her how she imagined that this would go she said she'd only asked me over because I wanted to break off contact otherwise. And that it was a bad idea. She gave me a 50€ bill for gas and very reluctantly, I left.

I asked to hug her goodbye. She declined. I left the house, and started crying. I called a friend and told her about what happend, as I walked around the town she lives, my car parked about 20 meters from her driveway. After about 20 minutes or so, I arrive back at my car, and I'm still talking to my friend on the phone. I sit down in the trunk of my car and cry more as I'm talking to my friend. She comes outside, and asks me to leave because I'm making her nervous. I was completely destroyed at this point. I just mumbled something like ""Okay, I'm leaving.""

And then I drove around a few corners, cried some more while talking to a friend and slowly started heading home.

Now, this morning she sent me a message about how it's not okay to try and discuss things after she told me to leave because I disrespected her boundaries. And she said it's not okay for me to wait outside her house for an hour after being told to leave.

I responded saying how sorry I was. And I did explain I wasn't waiting for her or anything, I just had to process what happened. And I said sorry for not taking her worries about meeting seriously, and thinking it would turn out okay. And that was it. She blocked me.

Mal was neglected (and maybe abused) by her previous owners before she came to us. I say maybe due to no significant evidence. However she was locked in a cage daily, only let out in the back garden for five minutes before being shut back in again. They fed her big chocolate bars (not the dog friendly ones) and I know this as PO told me themselves. They were just awful. 

I love her so much, but not many people feel the same way. Because of her constant desire to be the centre of anyone’s attention, she’s in your face most of the time.

If you stop, she’ll nudge your hand or lean over your lap. She’s very affectionate.

So here’s my issue. My boyfriend really does not like Mal. He thinks “she isn’t his type of dog” and he isn’t “used to having such a needy animal”. He, like my mother, prefer bigger dogs.

Mal has had a few accidents in our home and my boyfriend threw the biggest tantrum because the poor girl pissed herself with excitement when we got home a few weeks ago.

I will be attending an instate college, so with financial aid and scholarships, I should be able to graduate with very minimal loans. 

Now I have a few reasons why I want to move out, primarily, I want to experience not living with my family. I don’t hate them or anything, but I do feel like they don’t treat me like adult sometimes. They absolutely refuse to respect my privacy. They don’t let me lock my bedroom door and don’t knock before entering, they’ve nearly caught me beating my meat a couple times. They claim this is out of concern and their responsibility and right as parents, but for what I hope are obvious reasons, I disagree.

My parents are absolutely against me moving and it’s a hill they are willing to die on. I understand their mentality as Immigrants and devout Hindus and wanting to take care of their kids but o already feel so constricted living here, I couldn’t imagine it for another four years. My mom is having some family and mental health issues, which is another reason they cite against me moving, and it really does make me feel like shit for possibly worsening that. But I’ve got to live too, you know? 

So basically AITA for wanting to move against my parents wishes? It will absolutely devastate my mom

bytb0y,1560139841,AITA for doxxing a man who followed me home in his car?,"I’m a 19 year old college girl, and just today I was driving home on the freeway. I was in the far left lane, but the car in front of me was going **extraordinarily** slow (to the point that if a cop had been there, I’m positive he would have received a ticket.) I had a hard time getting out of the left lane since there were a long line of passing cars in the lane next to me; so I stayed behind him. I tried my best to be patient, and I didn’t tailgate or honk at him.

Just a while later, the guy brake checked me for no reason. I had to slam on my brakes, making a bunch of my stuff fall down and scaring the shit out of me. I got out of that lane about 30 seconds later, rolled down my window, and as I passed by him I shouted “**COCKSUCKER**!” at the top of my lungs. Seconds later, I was scared to see him suddenly changing lanes and pulling behind me.

His car stayed behind mine for the remainder of the drive home (about 4 miles). I grew nervous; wondered if I should call the cops; and when I pulled into the driveway of my house (which I share with 2 friends) he pulled next to the sidewalk in front and came out of his car. He was an older man (early 70’s I think), and he asked me if my parents were home, and that if so he needs to talk to them.

I told him I don’t live with my parents and am legally an adult, and he responded “That’s surprising. You sure don’t behave like one.” He went off on this big tangent about how vile what I yelled was, and how I have “no respect for my elders”, and the typical grandpa/old man type spiel about how I’m a spoilt millennial brat. I stuck up for myself, telling him, “I don’t care if you’re the fucking Queen of England. I’m not treating anyone with respect if they drive like an asshole and put lives at risk.”

He kept spewing nasty stuff at me and pushed to come inside and “speak to my parents” (even though I’d told him I don’t live with them), and I pointed to my friends’ cars out front, told him I’m not alone, and that I’ll call the cops if he doesn’t go. Finally he left; and as he did so I snapped a photo of him and took down his license #. I went to multiple Facebook groups (one for my college campus, one for my city, and one a college group that provides support for women dealing with stalking/violence/assault.) I posted his photo, license # and this message:

**This man stalked me (a 19 year old girl) all the way home last night in his car, intimidated and harassed me, and didn’t leave until I threatened to call the police. Had my roommates not been clearly home for him to see, I fear that things wouldn’t have ended well for me, and that I might not be here typing this. To all young women in this city and at my school, don’t let this sick creep intimidate you and call the cops if he tries to do so. Stay safe! <3**

I also sent his photo/plate to the cops. I feel very justified doing all this; but one of my friends (who I live with) expressed concern that I’m going too far. AITA?",False,everyone sucks,8,34,1
bu64sv,1559080539,AITA for not wanting to buy my mother another gift with the family?,"My mother has her birthday in May just a couple weeks after Mother’s Day. This can often mean gifts that get pushed together to be given as one or me and my siblings all going in together to buy a large gift. 

This year, I messaged all my siblings mid April to see if they wanted to buy my mother an expensive gift together. It was something my mother wanted, and I knew if we all split it between our budgets on Mother’s Day/birthday it would be affordable. I was told this year they did not want to do this because they went over budget on their Christmas gift 2018. I said ok, no big deal, and went and bought my mother separate Mother’s Day/ birthday gifts from me and my spouse/children. 

It is to be noted that all of my siblings live out of town. So the day before Mother’s Day two of them asked me to pick something small up for my mom for them. 

I went quite over budget on the birthday gift, but I justified it as it is a milestone birthday. Her birthday way yesterday. 

Today my dad sent out an email chastising everyone because I was the only one of her 7 kids to call her on her birthday. This prompted my brother to reach out to everyone saying we should all pitch in to buy my mom a big gift for her birthday and give it to her this summer when we are all together. 

I replied that I asked us to do that a month ago and was told no, and that I already bought mom and gift for her Mother’s Day and Birthday. My siblings feels like I am “ruining a good thing”.

My brothers words were “I recommend we do a joint gift. Just something nice from each of the kids. Or you could pass and forever be shamed.”

When I said that I felt frustrated that I tried to arrange something a month ago and the day after her birthday get a message about a group gift I got told I was stirring drama. 

I feel like I should just do it because it is something nice for my mom and my mom is a wonderful person who deserves all the things. At the same time I feel like this is my siblings trying to make up for not thinking of my mom on her 65th birthday and I did everything I could to show my mom I cared on her actual birthday.

She recently made the assertion that it's fine to not ask if something has dairy/eggs/etc. if there isn't any other possible vegan option to eat when traveling. I thought that was irresponsible as a vegan, and that she was being lazy. Her response was that I was being too militant and enforcing my ideas on her. I'm not budging from my position of 100% veganism being the goal, and she is not budging from the position of not bothering to find out if something is vegan when she isn't sure.

EDIT: Thank you for the candid feedback. I thought some clarification might save my face and that of other vegans: I'm never this militant with anyone else other than my sister; I love when my meat-eating friends make small changes. I happen to see my sister as a ""vegan role model"" (and the fact that she is a self-declared vegan), and I was taken aback when I learned she wasn't perfect. Also, kinda thought being vegan was a strict, 100% no animal-products definition (where the gatekeeping arises), but I'm in the wrong, it seems.

dafq8a,1569675926,AITA for kicking out my friends boyfriend when he drove three hours so they could visit?,"Okay, I’m on mobile and I’m annoyed and hella emotional right now so I’ll try to explain this as best as I can. 

Two nights ago I found out my (23f) boyfriend (26m) who I’ve been with for three years and live with cheated on me. We were supposed to have two of my best girlfriends and one of their boyfriends (the guy in question, we’ll call him Chuck) come up to visit and stay with us this weekend, which is really sucky timing. 

My boyfriend went to stay at his dads for a while to give me some space, and yesterday before my friends drove up I told them what happened, and that I couldn’t be around our whole “squad” right now with out him so is it okay if the girls, my best friends since middle school, stay at my house tonight and then the boys, which consists of our boyfriends all of which have been around for at least two years, stay at my other friends apartment up here. (I told my boyfriend he can go there if he wants but he chose to just go to his dads for the weekend) 

So when I’m sitting with my friend who already lives in my area waiting for the rest of my friends to get here she says that Chuck is apparently saying there’s no way he’s the extra 15 minutes to get to the other apartment and it’s “mean” that I’m kicking him out. He said this apparently in a joking way but clearly he actually didn’t think he was going to have to go because when everyone got here he opened up a beer and sat down. That’s fine, I was going to let him have one beer with us and then kick him out. 

So he sits down and like 6 or 7 minutes in he says he’s hungry, he’s going to get some food, and asks if anyone else wants any. No one wants any and I say something like “I’m sorry to kick you out but I just really need to be with my girls tonight so maybe you can get Trey (my other friends boyfriend who’s at the other apartment) some food on the way over there.”  He then mopes around and leaves and is low key pissed at me and He apparently texted his girlfriend later like “Thanks a lot for trying /s” because she didn’t try to ask if he could just stay. 

He did just drive three hours to get here and under normal circumstances I would never kick him out but honestly right now I just don’t care? It’s kind of a dick move to put me in the position of literally having to kick him out when I already have so much to worry about and process right now. And I think his girlfriend should’ve been the one to kick him out because otherwise it made me the bad guy.

blu6d9,1557253281,AITA for not telling my date I am balding?,"So I hope I'm asking this in the right sub. Don't know for sure if this is a true 'moral dilemma', but here I go.

I'm 25, just graduated and am trying my hand at dating again. Thing is though, I'm balding like a mo-fo and it really wears down my confidence. So a while ago I was looking into some good non-surgical hair replacements and found a hairdresser that offers 'hair systems' near me. I ended up going and now I once again have a glorious mane. Even though I didn't grow it out of my own head, it gave me the needed confidence boost to put myself out there.

Sure enough, I soon hit it off with a nice woman. I clicked with her from day 1. We have some similar interests, we are likeminded, she is my type, I seem(ed) to be hers and we're both out and looking.

So around the third date she commented on my hair. Told me I looked great, had a nice hairstyle, and so on. Because I remain pretty insecure about my hair loss, I missed the opportunity to 'playfully' reveal my secret and tell her about my - what essentially is a - hair piece. I felt like we still hadn't completely connected personality-wise and this would be a tipping point for her breaking things off or keeping things going. Idk, I just didn't have the heart to say it then and postponed it.

A few dates later we ended up sleeping together and she surprisingly liked it kinda rough. What happened next you just can't make up... So in the rush of the moment, with her on top, she freaking pulled the hair piece from my head... The glue that is used for hair systems is usually very strong, and doesn't admit defeat to even the most extreme conditions (sweating your ass off on a hot day, while exercising, in heavy rain, you name it), but I guess she just pulled hard enough for it to come loose (at least partially).

What ensued was about the most awkward chain of events I have ever experienced. She sorta sat there looking at a piece of my hair hanging loosely from my skull. Seeing my embarassment she fled into the bathroom to get dressed, left me there with my boner like a candle in the wind. She didn't really comment on the hair, just said ""well, this is kinda awkward"" and made up some excuse to gome home early. 

She then spent about a week ghosting me. When I finally got ahold of her over the phone to offer my apologies and to explain what had happened, she told me swiftly that I had betrayed her trust, by not telling her about my balding head. Even though she had explicitly complimented me on my hairdo. She told me she didn't really care about the baldness but the dishonesty could not be overlooked. And that if I saw it fit not to tell her about something 'as simple as this', she wondered what else I would omit. She took it pretty bad obviously and thus we broke up (if we ever were a thing in the first place).

arkeat,1550408855,AITA for not telling my half-brother who his real father is?,"The main players:

Me - on 23andme

Sister - full-blooded sister, younger than me and has our father on a pedestal

Father - deceased for 17 years, was an alcoholic and possibly a sex offender

Half-brother - in jail for 10 years, convicted rapist.  Will be released in 2 years.



So thanks to the miracle of 23andme and DNA relatives, I recently found out that I have a half-brother through my father.  I actually matched with his 13yo daughter on the website, and through comparing timelines, photos, stories from relatives... We've come to the conclusion that the only way she could share such a large percentage of DNA with me was if her father was my half-sibling.



Before we go any further, my half-brother's real father has been CONFIRMED by his mother.  As in, our assumptions were correct and that he really is my half-brother.



-----begin family story------


Feel free to skip, but this is the story as we know it.  My father dropped out of school when he was 16 and moved from Pennsylvania to Florida for work.  A couple years later at 18 he hit a rough patch and moved back in with his mother in PA.  At this time he began hanging around a local 16yo girl.  My father only stayed in PA for a couple months before moving back to Florida.  No one from my father's family ever heard of the girl again.



Turns out, the girl was pregnant.  This was a small, rural, Catholic town so she couldn't have a child out of wedlock.  She found another guy, married him ASAP and passed off the son (my half-brother) as this other man's child.  Now if this guy knew that the child wasn't his, we don't know!  Also unknown is if my father ever knew about his son.



Fast forward 20-some years, and my father marries my mother and I am promptly born.  7 years later my sister was born.  4 years after that (about 30 years after the birth of my half-brother), my father died in a car accident.  My parents had a very tumultuous relationship and divorced a couple years after my birth.  They were in stages of separation/reconciliation all the way up to his death.  My mother moved me and my sister away from Florida and we lost contact with my father's side of the familly.


-----end of family story------



My half-brother is in jail for raping his teenage niece.  He will be released in a couple of years.  He is almost fully estranged from his daughters (my half-nieces) but they do contact him occasionally.



My sister and I are arguing over whether we should write and tell him who his real father is.


My argument:

1) this guy is a POS and I don't want any contact with him.

2) I don't think we're the right ones to tell him this, let his mother tell him.

3) our father has been dead for over 15 years.  There isn't much I'm going to be able to tell half-brother about him.

4) THIS IS SOMETHING I DIDN'T TELL MY SISTER but turns out our father was a POS too.  He was a heavy alcoholic, actually died driving drunk.  What my sister doesn't know was that my father was arrested for sexual assault... right around the time I was conceived.


My sister's argument:

1) he is going to find out eventually anyway, between his daughters and his mother

2) if his mother tells him, she might paint our father in a bad light.  We should tell him first and preserve our father's image.



I acknowledge that my sister's two points are valid, but I think my 3rd and 4th points counter her 2nd point.



IMPORTANT:  I am not refusing contact with my half-nieces because of their father.  Since they're both minors, I'm letting them (and their mother) decide how much contact they want.  I am more than happy to talk to them and even meet with them in person.

My wife does most of the paperwork, gift buying, stuff like that.  She signed him up for summer sports. I take him to all the games and practices as well, I'm not checked out by any means.  

When she signed up for the latest league, you have to create a profile online.  We have a joint email address for things like this, which she used, and put her name in the guardian name field ""Wife LastName"".  Later she changed the name on the account to ""OP & Wife LastName"".

I knew having my wife's name show up anywhere on the ""guardian"" profile was going to be an issue.  It always is.  Anytime my wife shows up or has her name on anything, I get all kinds of shit from my ex.  ""SHE'S NOT HIS MOM"". ""HE HAS A FUCKING MOM"".

My wife saw that the invite to the sports website (an invite that my wife sent to my ex, from our profile) was accepted and told me to brace myself, the invite had just been accepted.  Like clockwork, my phone starts going off just then.

>Why is *stepmom* listed as a guardian? She is not a guardian. That is OUR son. I gave birth to him and I'm an involved mother. I'm tired of this shit.""

I responded ""It's my profile"". It went on tangents after that.  

I knew this was going to happen.  I left my wife's name on the account because she *is* involved, she created the account, got him signed up, and passed along all the info.  And, it doesn't actually matter to anybody other than my ex.  The coaches don't care.  The schools don't care. Nobody cares that my son's stepmother is listed on anything, other than my ex.  

But, it causes me all sorts of stress.  It's something I've been dealing with for 10+ years and I have not found a good way of coping.

My wife knows this.  I was hoping she would realize the stress it causes outweighs whatever benefit she gets out of having her name on some profile on a league website. I asked her what she gets out of putting her name on things like that. She said it comes down to a matter of pride that she doesn't get recognition for the things she does and it's all because of my ex's pettiness and insecurities.  That's true (if my ex wasn't in the picture, it wouldn't be a problem), but as I said above, the coaches don't care.  They know who she is.  Why is it so important that she leave her name on the profile?  I didn't roll over when my ex tried barring my wife from games or school events.  But this just seems like such a nothing thing, for both of them to get wrapped around the axels about.

She takes it as me asking her to be invisible to appease crazy.  I said I cannot reason with my ex, but I can reason with my wife.

This lifestyle has led to them accumulating huge debts for which my husbands parents have cleared many of them. We have been asked to contribute to clearing the debts and my husband gets guilt tripped by his family and would like to out of guilt, however I have put my foot down and said no and so we haven't.

My husband’s brother approached him recently asking to borrow a sum of money as he was going overdrawn due to loans supposedly leaving his bank account and him having spent the money for it elsewhere. He said he could not tell his wife as she would be furious. My husband gave his brother the money without discussing it with me (a separate issue we are currently working through), and also said he did not have to repay it. My husbands family are also attending a sports event soon and his brother said he would not go as he could not afford it. My husband said he would pay for his ticket again without discussing it with me, and also said he did not need to repay it. I have since found out about all of this and I am livid to say the least.

Initially I told my husband that his brother did not have to repay us and we would work on other issues related to this such as my husband feeling guilty when asked for money and not being able to say no. However I have today found out that my husbands nephew (son of his brother) attends a private school with significant fees, and will be there for at minimum another year. I always knew they didn’t live within their means, but to know concrete that they are paying x amount a month for private school, but then are asking my husband to borrow money has infuriated me. I have told my husband to say to his brother that he does in fact need repaying for the money he gave him and for the sports event ticket, and to get a timescale for when it will be repaid. My husband is refusing to ask him and is saying it is his fault and that moving forward he won’t do this again. Whilst the amount is not significant, I want the money back out of principle.

Update: I can see some saying that I would suck if I asked for repayment after my husband told his brother he did not need to be repaid.

I regularly do the dishes. She does...not. She rarely does them. She hates doing the dishes. We have to handwash them since our apartment doesn't have a dishwasher. 

She will say repeatedly that she'll do them (I don't nag her--but internally, something's yelling at her to do them) but then, usually, I end up doing them after a long day usually due to her typical x, y, and z excuses. 

Yesterday, she gave my least favorite excuse: ""I had to walk away from them because of my pet peeve. Grease."" 

If I notice that even after she's promised repeatedly to do them and doesn't (especially when we have a surplus of them--she does a LOT of cooking), I'll do them at the end of a long day--I usually get home after a 9.5 hour shift, take an hour, go livestream some video games, then rest. Apparently, I can't feel a lot of grease around suds, which seems to be my failing. Even so, I swear to God, I tried.

The other morning, she told me she couldn't do them the night before because she was annoyed by the grease. Annoyed, I told her, point blank, she needs to get over it. 

As I see it, if you don't do dishes after repeatedly saying you would, then I do them, you have no right to complain anyway.

dcsvkm,1570118361,AITA for asking for my sweater back?,"To me, I feel like this is a no brainer,  but someone is acting like I’m an asshole so thought I’d ask.

Context: I broke up with my long distance girlfriend earlier this week. She just moved to France from her home country for a great job opportunity for a year. However, when she visited me during the summer, we found out we had some dealbreakers that would make our future together impossible (Eg: I don’t want kids, she does). I try breaking up with her in person because I thought it was the right thing to do, she asked me to think on it a bit more, I agreed. Two-three weeks later, she’s now in France and I decide I don’t want to drag it out anymore. 

BUT she has my sweater which holds sentimental value to me. Easiest way to describe its value, is that it’s like how a sports player might value an old jersey. And I want it back. 

My ex asked me not to contact her after the breakup, so to respect that I messaged her friend to tell my ex I want it back and would pay for the shipping. She flips out at me asking me if it’s really worth it after the pain I’m putting my ex through. She thinks I should just forget about it.

So am I the asshole for asking for it back?

TL:DR I asked my ex’s friend for my sweater with sentimental value back, but she thinks I’m an asshole for even bringing it up.

INFO: She had the sweater in her home country since  March and did not bring it here in the summer. So I could not have asked for it back in person unfortunately.",1570118759.0,not the asshole,5,12,0
dalwg7,1569704933,"AITA for confronting my aunt about the ""creative non-fiction"" she published about our shared trauma?"," Hi, Reddit!

A quick back story: I \[30, f\] grew up with a single mother, ""Marie"" who was an addict. While I believe she was a good person underneath this, her addiction resulted in emotional abuse and child neglect. Unfortunately, she died of an overdose in 2010. You can imagine this has led to some highly complicated family dynamics.

Fast forward to present day, my aunt ""Diane"" \[60, f\] casually mentioned that she had published a few pieces of ""creative non-fiction,"" but asked that I not share it with anyone if she were to share it with me. This naturally piqued my interest.

After searching Diane's name online, I found a story she wrote and published about my mom in a literary magazine. The story included many criticisms of Marie, including many very personal details about her behavior as an addict, with a detailed narrative of how she died and how her body was discovered. To make matters worse, the only details that were changed were character's names. Note that Diane was not present for many of these events later in Marie's life given that my aunt lived in a different state.

I wrote her an open and honest email about how hurtful this was to read (seriously, I had an emotional hangover all week). She replied to explain herself, but also stated that, ""You took the extra step of going on line and reading these on your own.""

I honor that she has trauma of her own, but AITA for feeling violated by this and wanting to protect my mother's name?",False,asshole,11,9,1
b8trn4,1554267751,AITA For 'taking' a DnD group from someone.,"Hey there, this is a throw away account because i know the guys involved frequent reddit and have occasionally referenced this subreddit.

I am currently in university and myself and my group of friends were all pretty interested in starting a DnD campaign, none of them have any kind of experience, and i only have 2 campaigns under my belt, so i volunteered to be the DM because no one else had any idea of what to do. After some initial plans we all got excited to give it a try.

After a week or so of planning a couple of our other friends heard of our plans and also became interested, one of them (We will call Fred)  it turns out was an experienced DnD player and was a frequent DM before university and was very keen on running this campaign, and since i only took the position out of necessity people were fine with this change, but this is where the issue is.

The only issue is Fred's girlfriend, they are both living together at the time but she has a host of mental health issues and is basically dependant on him, she frequently has break downs and requires him to be with her. I'm not here to comment on the relationship or her,  but to portray how serious it can be, he usually misses 30-50% of all of his lectures at the university because she needs him to stay at the house. 9 times out of 10 any social plans he has been invited to will usually result in a message on the chat that he 'can't make it'.

The plans for this campaign were to have a weekly session lasting 4-5 hours, but i knew that would be extremely problematic, with how erratic his girlfriend can be, there was simply no conceivable way we could possibly plan a day in advance and there were a very strong chance any agreed upon days would have the DM unable to come, let alone remain the entire time.

Eventually i talk to my friends (and not Fred at this time) and simply said, because of his personal life, there will NOT be a campaign if he is the one DMing it, reluctantly the others agreed and i was put in the DM position.

&#x200B;

Eventually he found out and when we ran into each other on campus he stopped me and said that i was being quite rude to him and that ''if i wanted to DM that badly i should have just said'' unfortunately i couldn't really give an honest answer because he can be extremely touchy about his girlfriend, and all i could say was that it'd be really difficult to schedule things and this is how it turned out.

He sort of just shook his head at me and left, and he has been quite silent on the group chat since.

Just before Christmas, her oldest brother (32M) got into an argument with his parents which resulted in his temporary living conditions becoming very much up in the air. It was just before the holidays, mind you, and my roommate and I are both very family oriented, so when he asked if he could crash on our couch, she and I agreed. 

I feel bad because I think he was trying to do his best, but he'd make comments about how clean it is in the apartment (we have three cats, it's clean, but lived in), or how my roommate is doing something wrong (disparaging comments about her weight or what she eats or why she isn't cooking dinner). 

New Year's Eve rolls around, he's still on our couch, switching between our place and his other sister's for the lease's sake... my roommate left for work early that morning, and I got up, did my business, and in the interim, the brother left the house. So, I locked up and went on my merry way. 

I found out later that he'd left the keys inside and just left the door unlocked, which I had then locked. He blamed my roommate and I was out forty bucks for a quick cab ride back to unlock the door for him. 

He's in a bad spot; he lost his job, he's on the outs with his folks-- rough, right? I feel badly because my roommate and I agreed that he needed to go. All of his negativity towards my roommate, the house, in addition to drinking an entire bottle of very expensive rum we'd been saving for a special occasion, in addition to all of our wine and the ""replacement"" whiskey he'd bought for us on NYE-- it was too much. 

I feel badly because it's so obvious that he's in a bad place right now, I just don't think there was anything else we could do. My roommate agrees that it was necessary, I just feel like a jerk because he still hasn't gotten on his feet.

Her mom has always tried to make our relationship a living hell to the point where i had to get on anxiety medication. She recently transferred universities to be closer to me. Unbeknownst to me, her mom would only let her transfer universities if she could track her phone. This would prevent her from visiting me, and from going out to partys and bars.

ay3gzh,1551903956,AITA for not giving my dad a birthday present?,"Throwaway and this happened several years ago. 

My parents divorced when I was about 12 and my dad had to take over the company they shared together. For several years we didn't see him because he had to work so hard to keep this company running to pay for our and his bills since my mom had a burnout. When we did see him again he kept telling us how awful of a person my mom was for doing this to him, and telling us how she 'wasn't as good as she pretends to be' by giving examples of bad things she did to him, like hiring an expensive lawyer to get custody. We kept telling him this wasn't any of our business, but despite this, at any small inconvenience or any time he went through a rough time he would bring her up. He would also get angry at us for dumb reasons like not doing the dishes when he wasn't home despite him never mentioning that he wanted us to do them. He really hurt me and, as far as I can tell, my brothers with this because we love them both and to have someone you love say such bad things about someone else you love as well is just hurtful. 

Because of all of this, I stopped really caring for him and one of my brothers stopped visiting him alltogether. He is my dad and I love him, but he was acting so childish about all of this that I didn't care to give him any presents or show him that I cared. At the time I got my first job and was finally able to buy an electric guitar, as I had dreamed of for years, causing me to blow the money I earned pretty quickly. I knew my dad's birthday was coming up, but honestly, I didn't care. I didn't buy him a present, and my one brother who visited my dad with me didn't either. He got upset, and still brings it up to this day, and even mentioned this in a talk about how we let him down and he let us down. This shows he does realize he let us down as well, but I am not sure to what extent since he never mentioned that. Was I the asshole? Did I do something horrible or was it justified? It plagued me for a while now since I know I hurt his feelings, I just wonder if this was an inherentely bad thing.

Once she met her girlfriend she started seeing me more as we could do couples stuff but it's still not often we all see each other.
A couple who are invited to the wedding are very close friends I game with who live in a different city but we speak & skype often & visit each other for long weekends. This becomes relevant I promise.

Anyway, the other night her girlfriend (GF) messaged me asking what time they needed to be at the hotel for the wedding as my friend needed to book time off work. I told her that they weren't invited to the wedding & maybe she'd confused it with the party we were hosting after we returned from our honeymoon. No reply to the message straight away but saw it.

I went to bed & the next morning had messages off both the GF & my friend. My friend simply stating how she'd sort it but was disappointed in me & her GF going off at me about how we were such close friends & how I'd ruined her plans to propose to my friend at MY wedding & that she wouldn't forgive me, especially as I'd invited ""Random geeks off the internet"" (Told you it was relevant).

I muted the chat & got on with my day. When I did look back through her messages she'd played the gay card (I'm bi) & said she'd been dreaming about the wedding & planning how and when to propose. I told her she was obsessive & that she needed to realise that it was my wedding.

I got a message from my friend telling me I shouldn't have been rude to her GF & that we'd known each other a lot longer than the other friends I'm inviting, however they know my favourite colour & my partners middle name whereas she called my partner Bill for 2 years. I told her if she didn't like it they didn't have to talk to me again & they should just forget about the party though if they apologised I'd reconsider letting them attend the party though the apology had to be in person.

How do you not tell you son he has high-functioning autism for 25 years? If things had been great between us, I would have disregarded this.

We got quite close as she was sharing a lot about her new boyfriend and excitement around the topic. I was also going through similar things at the time and we met a few times a month one on one outside of our friend group. 

As their dating progressed she started to spend less time with her girlfriends including me. Early spring they got engaged.  When they announced that the wedding would be this fall I offered to make a wedding cake for them. She refused the offer saying that their wish is to have everyone relaxed at the celebration and less focused on the labour and stress. Well cool I guess.

Oh so now your interested? Okay sure lets meet up and discuss.

So we sat down and talked. I asked her what has now suddenly changed since our conversation 5 monts ago. She said that the catering service doesn't offer anything they like. We made plans and had a good time. At this point I knew the time table and the region where the wedding will be held.

Few weeks later I had a tasting with them and they liked everything I presented. I asked them to make sure that there was a possibility to refrigerate the cake at the venue. A week later I got sent a screenshot of an email conversation they had with the catering. The catering said that they dont want anyone without an actual bakery to bring a cake due to former disappointments. So all plans were dropped.

Then as the wedding got closer I started to wonder if I was even invited? We were even discussing the seating order and everything before. ""You and all other friends would sit together here..."", she said when showing pictures of the venue. 
I never got an official invite or the actual timetable and address. 

Wedding is done now. Honestly I'm still confused about all of this. Did they forget about me? Also there's some personal issues that make me not want to support their marriage and I'm a little happy that I didn't have to by attending the celebration. But is that rude?

Me and my boyfriend were together for almost three years and things were great until i got pregnant. 

We were separated for most of my pregnancy because he decided he wasnt ready for a baby. I was fine with this because I was and I thought it would be better if he leave before i had the baby. 

But 2 months before i had our son he decides he wants to try to raise him together and be a family. After a couple days of thinking it over I agree because of several irrelevant reasons.

When our son was born he started being mean to me and putting me down a lot. I put up with it for 2 months because I knew how stressed he was with the new baby and I talked to him about it.

He said that the stress of work and a new baby was just getting to him but he would work on it and be better to me. 

After that conversation we went to bed and i thought things would start getting better the next day. But when we woke up he was really mad and he wouldnt even talk to me and I was trying so hard to think of what i could have done to make him so mad. 

When he finally answered me he said he was mad because he had to get up every other time with the baby. I told him that the only reason I got him up is because he agreed that he wanted to do it that way.

When i said that he got really mad and grabbed the baby by the arms and pulled him away from me. It took me a while but i finally got him to give me the baby back and when I did I told him I told him I didnt wanna be with him anymore and that he needed to leave.

What I planned is for him to go to work and when he got back we could talk about who would have the baby and when. But instead he left and went to the court house and tried to get emergency custody by saying i beat our son and screamed at him and the baby all the time. 

Then didnt grant him emergency custody and when we went to court the next day me and all three attourneys agreed that i should keep the baby and he gets him one night a week.

He turned down that offer so the judge decided that the baby will stay with me until the next court date. After that was decided him and his family got hostile and violent and made threats right outside the court room. 

Now the most he will get is supervised visitations and i am in a position where i would be able to let him see the baby more than that but i dont plan to because of him getting violent and threatening me.

I camp, adventure & go off grid for extended periods of time, everyone know it. My gf loves camping.

My gf & I decided earlier in the week to spend a quick night out under the stars in the national park we live right by. I mentioned this to my housemate in casual conversation. We didnt sit down & draw up a detailed plan as we wernt telling him for our saftey, but just as idle chit chat.

We also took all of our gear with us, which would have been really obvious to the housemate. Especially the portable gas stove which we had been using to cook with while we waited for an electrical to replace our broken stove.

<20 hours after we left & on our way back out of the campsite we bump into Search&Rescue. Apparently we where ""missing"".

Heres what Ive been able to peice together from the mother, search&rescue, the police etc. I havent been able to get the housemates version of events.

Late Saturday afternoon my partner sends her mother a text message. In a rush it turns out it was vaguer than it could have been. It said where we where going, just so someone knew, but no our return time. Later that evening the mother called us, but couldn't get through obviously, as theres no service in that park. She then calls our housemate to see if he had heard from us. He says he will go & look for us, the mother claims she told him not to. He takes his newly acquired but older/cheap/secondhand sportscar out (to what avail, I dont know). He calls back when he reaches to start of the park/dirt roads & says he has to turn back. According to the mother, he was to call when he got home & then theyd proceed further if no one heard from us by morning. On the way home he crashes & flips his car. Skid marks show he was drifting through the corner, spun out & rolled down the bank. thankfully he was OK. Not this was on well sealed bitumen. Car was totaled. He didnt have enough reception for an Uber, so eventually called the cops on himself to get home. Thats when we where reported as missing.

Once we are home, my small petite GF apparently spoke to our housemate first while I was unpacking. Apparently the only thing he said was to the effect of - get out of my sight before I punch you both in the head. Things have been very tense, he seems to hold deep resentment against us & blame for his car. We have avoided him since & I am yet to break the ice & speak.

I kind of feel bad that he crashed ""looking"" for his ""missing friends"". But his irresponsible crash is not my fault. Infact Im furious about what he said to my gf & honestly dont know what I would have done if I was there.

me and my girlfriend have been dating for 2 years, I'm 25 and my girlfriend is 24. 

last week my brother shared a post from a weed lovers Facebook page and included a funny caption. he has 2 kids and almost never smokes weed, maeby once a month at the most, and the kids are never home when he does. he also has no weed paraphernalia at his house. 

my girlfriend saw the post and questioned me on it, I explained exactly what I just told you and reassured her that the kids are fine. 

I then get a call from my brother a few days later, telling me that someone called CPS on him as they just did a welfare check on his kids. I automatically knew it was my girlfriend and confronted her, she told me that weed is bad for you and she was only thinking in the kids best interests. 

I just started yelling at her. 

I told her that I had explained to her how little weed he uses and that it's never kept at the house, I was beyond mad and made sure she knew that, I explained that she called CPS on a man who smokes weed once a month and that she is the worst person I've ever met. this caused her to start crying and she sobbed In the shower for an hour, and then tried apologizing but I refused her apology i also told her to not even bother apologizing to my brother as he does not want to see her. 
I then broke up with her. 

now I've accepted that we have broken up but now that my brain has cleared up I think I went a step to far and really need outside judgment on this. 

I'm just a complete mess of emotions.

b871sk,1554145383,AITA for not selling our car to friends?," 

So we have been renting our basement to Nancy.Nancy is a friend of my wife's and they work together. Nancy asks if her husband Dale can move in with their dogs for a newly negotiated rate. This was a few weeks into the tenancy. We agree on a rate for the increase in utilities, and Dale moves in with the dogs.It is noteworthy here that Nancy works contract positions all around the country. Generally, Dale will stay home while Nancy does this. In this new arrangement, Dale will continue to live here for the newly negotiated rate when Nancy leaves to do her next contract.

Nancy has some trouble with her car, I help to fix it, but she insists on taking it to the dealer instead. For three weeks I help Nancy out with rides to work, its a minor inconvenience but it works with my schedule so its not that big of a deal. For the last week, my wife and I suggest that they borrow our third car that we have been trying to fix up and sell. Its a great car, just has some oil pressure problems we've been working on diagnosing, so I make sure Dale knows what to do. They get the car back, and we ask them if they want to buy our car for about a third of KBB. It's taking up space and costs of insurance so we want to get rid of it. They indicate they do. From this point forward, Dale borrows our car frequently to run errands. They haven't made any downpayment and we still pay the insurance for it.

2 months later, we ask them if they are still serious because we are considering selling it. They say they are, but they don't have the money, and tell us to ""do what we need to do.""

We decide to list it on Craigslist, this was 4 days later. I ask Dale for the keys and tell him we are selling it. They are surprised. Nancy is upset and tells us that she thought the plan was that she was going to title it in her name, pay insurance, and make payments to us. I didn't know this, but she had a conversation with my wife where Nancy suggested this plan and my wife told her ""We can talk about it."" Needless to say, we don't like Nancy's plan, and indicate that we would rather just sell the car, payment in full, and be done with it.

Nancy then tells us that Dale and the dogs will need to move out when she goes to her next gig because the arrangement was contingent upon us furnishing a vehicle for him to drive while he stays with us, since they were going to buy our car. Additionally, he needs this vehicle because they have a dog with a serious medical condition and he needs to be able to take this dog to the vet. I was unaware that the terms of their tenancy were dependent on us providing him with a vehicle, and personally I feel manipulated. I also think its sick that they would hold the well being of this dog over our heads like some bargaining chip.

bgta8v,1556104203,AITA For playing the sexism card as a male,"I work in an office where I’m one of the youngest and lowest level employees along with two others. 
Being one of the low level staff I get asked to do a lot of admin/odd jobs that aren’t anything to do with my job role. 

This has never really bothered me while I was the only one at my my level & being the youngest (22) and hypothetically the fittest, however, a few months ago my work hired two girls my age at my level.

I initially thought great someone to share the load of “crap jobs” with so I can focus more on my actual work. Boy was I wrong 

Whenever it came time to lift a box or screw in a lightbulb I was always the only option,they aren’t allowed to lift a finger and my boss justifies it as “being a gentleman”

Which to me seems like bullshit 
I don’t expect them to be able to do everything, there are some boxes I can hardly lift but they could at least help with the small ones or the other jobs. 

I’m not the strongest either and coupled with the fact I have never had any manual handling training I have done my back in a few times which would have been easily avoided by sharing the job with someone else. 

So anyway we had our annual staff review this week and I decided to ask what the deal was and whether I could split the work. 

I first said that i felt lower than everyone else and I felt it unfair that I was the only one asked to do these jobs despite there being two others at my level.
My boss couldn’t comprehend this.
He said “you dont expect the girls to do this do you?” To which I said “yes and I find it quite sexist”

You might expect my argument to have been that they were being sexist towards women by saying they can’t do something, actually I went the other way and said they were being sexist towards me for giving me less favourable and harder jobs for being a male

To an old conservative man in England, any notion being “p.c” must be like a slap round the face and he basically laughed me out the door

Background: So, my boyfriend (31) and I (27) have been together for just shy of two years. We've been incredibly happy until now - the first six months I couldn't stop worrying about when the other shoe would drop, but it just never did! We decided to commit, we've signed a lease together and are all set to move in next week.. which leads us to the issue. 

&#x200B;

So my boyfriend works really difficult hours, this last week he's been regularly doing 12+ hours a day. I practically live at his anyway so I thought I'd be helpful and start clearing out the freezer last week. I love him to bits but honestly he's a bit lazy when it comes to upkeep - he had month old courgettes in his fridge that were looking less than great. Anyway, freezer was cluttered (we're going to have to fix this in the new place) and I came across these little bags? They had what looked like white gunk in it, honestly didn't think twice about it, just thought it was an old bag we'd used for peas or something. Chucked it in the bin. 

&#x200B;

Last night I get out of the bath and I have like five missed calls from my boyfriend, obviously I think it must be some sort of emergency, so I ring him back and he is *panicking*. I mean full on panic. I honestly thought he was dying. 

&#x200B;

But then he starts yelling at me about why the freezer is empty and how dare I go through his things and I had no right to do it! Now I'm just really confused and then he says something about throwing away his reserves. 

&#x200B;

Yes, that's right. His *reserves*. 

&#x200B;

I have no idea what he's on about so I ask him and he says he's been saving his sperm in case anything happened and keeping it in the freezer. Honestly, I feel like such a jerk, but it was so ridiculous I just started laughing! I feel so fucking bad about it - but honestly, he genuinely, honest to god thought he could freeze his own sperm in the freezer! Like, surely you would just go to the GP and ask about the process if you're that worried?! 

&#x200B;

He hung up on me and today was really cold - he's messaged me and said maybe we should reconsider living together.

74x88l,1507407716,AITA for not inviting a friend to a spur of the moment gathering?,"So a few days ago I had decided to bake a cake for a friend’s birthday (5 months late), so I invited over a friend of mine who is good at cooking and another who is just fun to be around (and who I haven’t seen in a while). So we started baking a cake, and I invited over another friend who was in the neighborhood. Anyway, we finish putting together a monster ice cream cake (I’m talking vanilla cake, homemade icing, pecan ice cream, homemade caramel brownies, more of the homemade frosting, more pecan ice cream, another layer of vanilla cake, more homemade frosting, and a penis made of icing on top. It tasted horrible) and walk it over to her house. When we got there, we decided to try the cake, and invited over another friend of ours that was in the neighborhood. So we took photos of the cake and regretfully took bites of it and everyone went on their way. As I get home, however, I get a text message from a friend basically talking about how bad his depression is right now and that my Snapchat story of baking the cake made him feel so lonely, and that we should have invited him. He also slips in the fact that his birthday is in ten days and he doesn’t know what to do because he is so lonely.
Here is the kicker. He has, over the course of a year, made himself very hard to be around, and while I told him I just forgot to invite him and that I’m so sorry, I did think about it, but thought that inviting him would have ruined the whole vibe. (Also note that everyone except for the two original people were in my neighborhood). When talking to other people in the group, all of them agreed that him coming along would be a bad decision, as for the last year he has consistently been a dick to us.
It is also interesting to note that he is a pathological liar, and while he is fun to be around at times, you can’t trust anything that comes out of his mouth, to the point that most of us don’t think he has depression, seeing as though he always brags about having it (?) and uses it as an excuse to get what he wants.

d9swgd,1569545400,AITA for telling my girlfriend that her drinking a lot in college is not the same level of addiction as what my parents are going through as heroin addicts?,"Me and my girlfriend have been really good friends/roommates since college. After college we started to date, and she sort of went on a bit of a health/spirituality/cleanliness craze. Like she talks about her previous self almost like it was some out of control party animal who was doing tons of drugs and alcohol every night, and that she is now cleansed and reformed. I am mostly cool with that, I don't drink or do drugs or anything either, but sometimes its a bit over dramatic. She never really drank THAT much in college. She would go out drinking maybe once a week and did stuff like shrooms or adderall maybe once every few months. It was never full blown alcoholism or anything like that. She makes it seem like she was just totally a requiem for a dream addict or something and she overcame it. She drank basically the same as everyone else at our college. Sometimes it reminds me of those weird religious converts who constantly talk about their past selves as shameful. 



Anyways, my parents are heroin addicts. They have been for a very long time now. They are also mostly functional addicts, you really wouldn't be able to tell they're addicts until they tell you. My girlfriend knew, and they knew my girlfriend knew going in. They've both known each other for a while. Anyways, I asked how they were doing, and if they planned to go to rehab any time soon (which usually results in failure, but might as well try) and my girlfriend sort of butted in and mentioned that meditation and healthy eating helped her kick her 'addictions' in college. She kind of went on for a bit (like 10 minutes about her techniques) and I could almost see my parents look at her like she was insane. Later on I mentioned that what she said was kind of weird, and that what she went through is not even close to what my parents have been going through, and she got very upset at the notion that her addictions were not comparable at all, and that addiction is addiction and alllll this stuff. I didn't want to get into it, I just kept saying, ""its not the same, its really not the same"" and she got very mad and started saying that its demeaning and awful to tell someone that their addiction wasn't really an addiction. We dropped it, but she kept on saying that it was seriously a terrible thing to tell someone, and the next morning she asked me to apologize and I did and said I shouldn't have said that. She was clearly still a tiny bit mad.



I've always kind of felt this way. It wasn't an addiction. I was there, we used to talk nearly every day, we were roommates, we hung out nearly every day. I know this makes me sound like a dick, but I think she has convinced herself she was an addict because it legitimizes her 'journey' from a fucked up person to a clean, healthy person. I also think it helps her seem more serious to her social media followers. We almost never talk about this aspect of her life (her health/clean living stuff) so it never really comes up.

My boyfriend owns a 2 bedroom house in a non-gentrified area of the city and it has a studio downstairs that’s turned into an AirBnB. This is relevant as he makes a few hundred dollars off this every month. 

His mortgage is $3800 and in his ideal world I’d pay half. I’m not sure what’s fair. I have offered to pay for utilities and groceries which probably is a max of $500. He said this wasn’t a good idea as he doesn’t think it sets us up for success in terms of me monitoring usage of electricity, lengths of showers, etc. In my ideal world I would pay somewhere under $1000 but no more. I’m currently paying $2000 for a nicer apartment, closer to work & better area apartment (no roommates). 

I’ve asked for advice from friends and the majority have said it’s weird to pay him rent like he’s a landlord and other friends have said why wouldn’t you just like you have been paying rent to your current landlord. 

He can afford to pay the full mortgage just fine and I can afford 50% just fine so this is more a matter of principles. Help?

Adding info based on comments:
- In all previous relationships I have paid 50/50 but this is different as he owns the house. 
- He makes twice as much money as me
- This is a serious relationship, talking engagement next year, kids in 2 years.
- I arrived at $500 - $1000 based on splitting a room which in that neighborhood a room in a house would be about $1200.
- Second room is his office, garage is solely used by him for his two cars. I don’t drive them but benefit from them.
- Not his fault but I’ll be financially responsible for my parents in the next few years, he is only financially responsible for himself.
- He hasn’t proposed splitting Airbnb gains.
- I do all the cooking, I love it, he loves it - we both win. I meal prep for him to have lunch during the week. He pays for dinners when we go out.
- Cleaning will likely be split.
- All home repairs and upgrades have historically been on him. There’s a full kitchen remodel coming up so advice on that would be helpful too.",1568265917.0,asshole,154,388,1

I'm usually the one who remains calm and composed in unusual or frightening situations and TBH I like that role (it makes me feel valued) but while travelling around areas that I feel I would already be slightly anxious I think it might ruin it if I had to feel anxious for both me and her.

On the deck I have a planter shelf, and a bistro table. Both of which are allowed by the Home Owner's Association because they are outdoor furniture. My neighbor moved in, about 5 months ago, and is a little annoying, but generally friendly. He asks for help a lot, and to borrow stuff, but he always gives it back which is great. Once he left a water bottle filled with something? on my planter shelf which weirded me out because he had to walk across the deck and stand in front of my door to put it there even though the stairs to get down are right next to his door, but he owned up to it so it seemed harmless.... Just weird

The issue is the deck. So a few months ago he brought this broken cushioned chair on the deck. It had grass all over it and he put it on my side of the deck. He told us that he was going to clean it, and then bring it inside. Cool, that's fine. Except he never cleaned it or brought it inside. Weeks go by, it was in the way of me getting to the door I moved it over to his side where it wouldn't be in the way of walking to my door. He FLIPS and goes off, yelling at  my SO saying it was petty and if we had a problem we should have talked to him instead of moving it. He goes on more and says how his stuff is nicer than ours anyway and tells us this drama is insane, all because I moved the chair 3 feet. I then later appologize saying I didn't mean to offend him I just had guest coming and didn't want them to have to walk around the chair which was true.

Fast forward to now, the chair is still out and it gets SOAKED every time it rains. I've never seen him sit on it and it takes a few days to dry after it rains because it isn't supposed to get wet.  He's also left sneakers, a lamp, paper towels, etc all out for weeks in the past, but those are gone now. The icing on the cake is he now has the broken cushioned  chair AND 4 dining chairs also stacked on our deck in front of HIS door for over a week. Or deck is small maybe 7x7 feet. It is an eyesore and degrades my property value. All this goes against the HOA rules as none of the furniture/items are meant to be outside, so I can easily report him.  But he'd know it was me. I don't want to talk to him because I'm afraid he is going to flip out again and I don't handle being screamed at well, and he is a little intimidating. WIBTA if I report him?

My dad ended up bringing up the topic of transgender bathrooms, and I disagreed with what he had said. My dad and I started to get a little heated during that, but for the most part it was fine. After this, my dad mentioned why he voted for Trump and then murmured about how he won’t talk about that tonight (Everyone in the house disagrees with him politically for the most part. I honestly think he has some of the views he has just for attention because I don’t remember him being like this when I was younger). He mentioned something about how he hates socialism and that’s why he hates Democrats. He said he didn’t wanna talk about this, but after saying that he clearly wanted someone to take the bait (he already looked like he was getting mad before because his face was getting red). I mentioned how I didn’t wanna talk about it, but I said that not all Democrats are socialists and that ended up setting him off. He started raising his voice and asking what my bases are. I told him I didn’t wanna talk about it tonight (he’d been drinking a lot and wasn’t really making sense sometimes. I know the discussion wouldn’t lead anywhere, or it would just get worse.). He kept egging me on to say something and I started getting angry because of this. I said I didn’t wanna talk about it again (louder than I was before) and he kept messing with me. I ended up yelling at him and told him that “I don’t wanna fucking talk about this because I know it won’t go anywhere.” I then went off to their guest room and everyone went to their own rooms shortly after. 

AITA? I didn’t want to yell at my dad, but he seems to always want to get in arguments (specifically with my older brother) about politics. It gets on my nerves because it’s one of the only things he constantly brings up even though everyone around him doesn’t want to talk about it most of the time. I know it’s wrong to yell at him, but it feels deserved from my end since he started egging me on first and wanted a reaction.  Thoughts?

tldr; my dad and I got in an argument and I yelled at him after he egged me on with political discussion.",False,not the asshole,3,14,0
bnkaf7,1557628769,WIBTA if I got a tattoo for my wife’s birthday?,"For my [38M] wife’s [39F] birthday I was thinking about getting her name tattooed on my forearm. I know that tattoos of a SO’s name are usually a bad idea, but we have been married for six years and been best friends for 25 (we met in 8th grade), so neither of us are going anywhere without the other. We own a home and all the crap people fill them with, so we don’t really “need” anything. I’ve talked about doing this before (not as a b-day gift) and she likes the idea, but I’m not sure if it would be selfish or not because it would be a tattoo on me. I keep thinking of that episode of The Simpsons where Homer gets Marge the bowling ball for her birthday. 

TIA

Edit: I wasn’t very clear on “need”. We both enjoy a child free lifestyle and with that comes disposable income, so it’s not uncommon for me to take her out to dinner or splurge at the mall on a whim.  Most of our gifts now are things we need or things the house needs because we surprise each other with things on regular days.",1557651036.0,asshole,3,20,1
