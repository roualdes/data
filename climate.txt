Temperature Summary Data, Geography Limited

Description:

     A random set of monitoring locations were taken from NOAA data
     that had both years of interest (1948 and 2018) as well as data
     for both summary metrics of interest (dx70 and dx90, which are
     described below).

Format:

     A data frame with 197 observations on the following 7 variables.

     station Station ID.

     latitude Latitude of the station.

     longitude Longitude of the station.

     dx70_1948 Number of days above 70 degrees in 1948.

     dx70_2018 Number of days above 70 degrees in 2018.

     dx90_1948 Number of days above 90 degrees in 1948.

     dx90_2018 Number of days above 90 degrees in 2018.

Details:

     Please keep in mind that these are two annual snapshots, and a
     complete analysis would consider much more than two years of data
     and much additional information for those years.
