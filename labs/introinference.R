## 1. From a sample of 122 college students you find that the average number of hours slept each night is 6.83.  Assume the population standard deviation is known, $\sigma = 1.8$ hours.

## a. Set up hypotheses to test if the average number of hours slept by college students is different from 8; use a significance level of $\alpha = 0.02$.

## b. Evaluate the above hypothesis test and state your conclusion.

## c. Calculate an appropriately matching confidence interval.

## d. Interpret your confidence interval.

## e. Does your hypothesis test conclusion match the conclusion from your confidence interval?

## f. How much do we care about the shape of the population distribution? Why?


## 2.  Biologists are often interested in population dynamics of groups of animals.  Some mathematical models claim that if less than half of a population is not producing at least three offspring on average, then that group is destined to population decline.  From a sample of 110 (offspring producing) individuals from the Order Carnivora, suppose you found that 58 produced at least 3 offspring.

## a. Set up hypotheses to test if the Order Carnivora is destined to population decline; use a level of significance of $\alpha = 0.05$.

## b. Evaluate the above hypothesis test and state your conclusion.

## c. Calculate an appropriately matching confidence interval.

## d. Interpret your confidence interval.

## e. Does your hypothesis test conclusion match the conclusion from your confidence interval?
